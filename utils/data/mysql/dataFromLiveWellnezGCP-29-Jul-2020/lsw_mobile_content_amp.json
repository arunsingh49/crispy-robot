Due to busy lifestyle, people usually don\u2019t able to take out enough time to incorporate a workout session on regular basis. This is exactly where running can help them transforming from unfit to a fitter lifestyle.</p><p><br></p><p>Running helps in keeping the body fit by improving metabolism rate, stamina and strength. It is also known as the best workout for obese people to reduce weight. Regular running is good in reducing stress and decreasing the chances of heart related problems. Running is considered as the most excellent cardio vascular exercise which helps in overall toning of body while working on different muscle groups at the same time.</p><p><br></p><p>Like any other cardio or weight training exercise, you need to keep some important things in mind regarding the body posture and balance. These important things can be considered as Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts of running which you should follow if you have running as the regular part of your fitness routine. Following these typical Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s not only helps in saving your bones from injuries but also helps in achieving effective results in lesser time.</p><p><br></p><p>Running effectively burns as much as 100 calories per mile. People usually believe that number of calories burnt depend upon the speed of running. However, this is absolutely a myth. In reality, it is the distance which matters in burning the number of calories. It is also very well important to know that running helps in boosting afterburn effect which makes your body burn more calories even after finishing your run.</p><p><br></p><p>It is well said that running is an all round complete exercise when it comes to fitness. It instantly starts working on your body by effectively burning calories and toning your body.</p><p><br></p><p>Let\u2019s talk about these do\u2019s and don\u2019ts in detail to have in \u2013 depth knowledge about running.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h2>1. Do: Invest in a good pair of running shoes<br></h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/5-dos-n-donts-to-run-better/close-up-of-good-running-shoes-worn-by-a-person.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='close up of good running shoes worn by a person' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>This is the most important thing to do while planning to add running in your daily fitness regime. If you are running on regular basis, you must invest in a good pair of shoes. A pair of good shoes always helps in painless running. They work well in reducing the amount of pressure created on your ankles and heels during running.</p><p><br></p><p>Running shoes are an essential part of a healthy running. They secure your legs from injuries by absorbing their pressure. Therefore, they successfully reduce problems like muscle rupture, joint pain and posture while you run.</p><p><br></p><h2>Do not: go for uncomfortable shoes just for their style, colour or cost.</h2><p>They will not allow you to run comfortably and hence, cost your desire to run forever. Due to a wide range of shoes present in the market, you can also end up buying a running shoe that cannot serve your purpose. Hence, buy those shoes which fulfil your running requirements.</p><p><br></p><p>Investing in a good shoe is as important as investing in a bat to play cricket. Always keep in mind to avoid running in worn-out shoes or shoes that are designed for other sports or activities.</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Do: Keep a track on changes by setting measurable goals</h2><p><strong><br></strong></p><p><strong><br></strong></p><p>To keep a track on changes and progress you are making through running, you can set some goals which can be measured over a certain period of time. The duration of that period can start from a week to two. Keeping track on your records always keeps you motivated and helps in achieving farthest goals possible in running.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Pick a goal on weekly basis which cannot only challenge your ability but can also be achieved within the set time frame. For example, if you are taking up running for the first time, try to run as long as you can and then set your goal to cover twice the distance till the end of the week.</p><p><br></p><h2>Do not: overdo or under do the mileage.</h2><p>The best way to run is not to run for distance rather run for time. When running with set goal of time, you will find more opportunity to run at an even pace. Hence, instead of covering long distance try to cover the exactly same amount of distance in lesser time every next time you run.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h2>3. Do: Start off Slow.</h2><p>Always keep in mind to start off slow. When you are taking up running, do not directly jump over to it. As you put your shoes on, start with light walking and simply take one step at a time. Keep walking for a few minutes to warm up your body. In this way, you will be able to conserve more energy for a good run.</p><p><br></p><p>Few minutes of walk will always help you to reduce the exertion level before picking up the speed. After walking, start jogging for some time to build momentum. This will also improve your stamina and reduce the level of heat that gets build-up in the body while running.</p><h2>Do not: pull off long and hard strides while running.</h2><p>Go for smaller strides. The more comfortable stride will always put a much lesser pressure and motion on your joints. This is one of the very beneficial ways to follow for low chance of rupturing in the muscles and joints.</p><p><br></p><p>It also aids in overall efficiency&nbsp;of your running technique.&nbsp;Using a shorter stride helps in maintaining a longer and healthier life of your joints.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h2>4. Do: Follow the right technique for running:</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/5-dos-n-donts-to-run-better/sporty-woman-stretching-before-a-run-on-a-beach-wearing-running-outfit-and-running-shoes.jpg' width='700' height='466' alt='sporty woman stretching and warming up before a run on a beach wearing running outfit and running shoes' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p>While running, you should focus on landing on the midsole of your foot. This is a better technique to follow for a healthy and effective run. Landing on your midsole while running (instead of your heels) gives aid to your muscles. With this technique, muscles momentarily grab the body weight during the mid-stride.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, it compensates on the extra pressure created on joints and muscles. Moreover, to achieve higher results in running, the right technique plays a very important role. In any form of physical activity, the better the technique is, the higher is the extent of impact on your body.</p><p><br></p><h2>Do not: land directly on your heels.</h2><p>Many people while running have this common tendency to land on their heels first. However, it is not only the wrong technique but also affects your overall efficiency to run. Landing with your heel first can cause problematic issues like continuous muscle pain in your back, knee and other joints. The technique of landing on your heels first tends to apply more pressure while taking the next stride.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>As a result, your body makes great loss of energy then and there rather saving it for your power walk. Do some stretching if you still feel muscular pain in joints even after following the right technique to run.</p><p><strong><br></strong></p><h2>Do: Eat before running.</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/5-dos-n-donts-to-run-better/healthy-food-items-rich-in-carbohydrates-and-protein.jpg' width='700' height='968' alt='healthy food items in a bowl that are rich in carbohydrates and protein. like: milk in a jug; bananas, oats, cereals, etc. in a bowl' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p>Eat a carbohydrates rich snack before hitting the track for run. To get ample store of energy in your body, take a small bowl of oats or a couple of bananas before heading for run. You should also prefer to add protein rich food in your diet. Proteins are important for repairing the muscles.</p><p><br></p><p>Moreover, while planning for a perfect running regime, always keep a gap of atleast 30 minutes to 2 hours between your meals and running time. A relentless running regime is of no use if you have no control and planning over your daily diet intake.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Do not: eat too heavy if your run is going to be the first thing in the morning.</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/5-dos-n-donts-to-run-better/sporty-woman-crossing-the-finish-line-while-running-and-is-happy-about-reaching-her-goal.jpg' width='700' height='700' alt='sporty woman crossing the finish line while running and is happy about reaching her goal. she is wearing running attire' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>Don\u2019t forget to keep a check on your food intake if you have scheduled your running for the afternoon or night. If you have pre- planned your running schedule, do not eat anything too heavy before hitting the track. Try to avoid certain foods just before running like legumes, white sugar, milk or milk products and food containing good amount of saturated fat. These foods tend to slow down the rate of metabolism while running.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>With the above dos and don\u2019ts, hopefully you will be motivated to run for better results. Running is an activity of enjoyment and achievement. It should be done with a free mind. It does not only help in maintaining physical fitness but also balancing mental peace. Add running in your fitness routine for atleast thrice a week. This will help you in staying healthy for a longer term.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "c_header_mobile_image_name":"http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/mobile/5-dos-n-donts-to-run-better/sporty-smiling-woman-running-on-beach-wearing-running-outfit-and-running-shoes.jpg", "c_header_mobile_image_alt_desc":"\"sporty woman running with a smile on a beach wearing running outfit and running shoes\"", "c_header_mobile_image_path":"img/blog-img/default", "c_header_mobile_image_width":"450", "c_header_mobile_image_height":"300", "c_created_on":"2017-12-06 06:57:48", "c_summary":"5 key Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for a better run", "c_title_tag":"5 key Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for a better run", "c_meta_desc":"\"5 key Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts for a better run\"", "c_non_amp_url":"5-dos-n-donts-to-run-better", "c_amp_url":"5-dos-n-donts-to-run-better", "c_category_url":"running", "c_category_display":"Running", "c_modified_on":"2018-04-21 19:52:15"},

So whether you are an athlete or not these running exercises can help you boost your stamina as well as increase speed. But before you start your workout, keep in mind to start it with a warmup.</p><p><br></p><p>Warming up before working out reduces the risk of injury, increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases heart rate which in turn helps you in burning more calories. <br>A good warmup can be something like; a 6-8 minutes of jogging, mild/light exercises and stretching. This piece of writing focuses mainly on the running workouts or exercises that help you to increase your speed and stamina. So let\u2019s dive deep in and get our kicks running. <br></p><h2><br>1) Run Long</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/1-run-long.jpg' width='700' height='465' alt='Man running a long distance run along a long road-bridge with mountains in the background.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Its simple \u2013 To run more, you actually have to \u201crun further\u201d. The best way to increase you running distance is by increasing the running time by 5 minutes every day or by increasing running distance everyday (approx 0.5 miles daily). It might sound a little but it really adds up in the end.</p><p><br></p><p>The good idea is to run at a slow pace and be consistent in completing the track rather than running fast and then struggling to finish. Once you get hold of it then increase your speed. There\u2019s a great saying that \u2013 \u201cSpeed follows Endurance\u201d. So completing your run till the last mile decided and this is surely going to increase your speed as well as stamina.</p><p><br></p><h2>2) Tempo Runs</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/2-tempo-runs.jpg' width='700' height='1054' alt='Young woman running in sports outfit, seems to be in a tempo run to increase speed and endurance.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Tempo runs basically range for a shorter distance but at a pace higher than the normal at which you would generally run. Release of Lactic acid in your body is the reason behind the fatigue that you feel. Tempo runs like these trains your body in cleaning out lactic acid from your bloodstream quicker. This means that you can run at longer intervals and the lactic acid and fatigue building up in your body at a slower rate. It also makes you feel easier at running pace. Tempo runs are the key to improve the running speed.</p><p><br></p><p>For mid range and novice runners, tempo runs should last for about 20-30 minutes and approximately an hour for high end or advanced runners. Tempo runs should be done at a pace that you can maintain over the whole running duration rather than an all-in-one effort at a time leading to panting and slowing down. <br></p><p><br></p><h2>3) Interval Training</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/3-interval-training.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Young man running on pavement.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Interval trainings are a great way to increase your stamina, speed and endurance. Interval trainings basically involve alternating you running styles and speed. An example would be \u2013 Sprint as fast as possible for an interval of 30 seconds and then slowing down to a speed approximately 70% of your sprint and then continuing at that speed for another 2-3 minutes and after that again start sprinting.</p><p><br></p><p>Another example would be \u2013 running on an inclined path. This allows the body to recover in between the sprinting and slow running sessions. You can repeat these intervals approx 4-5 times keeping walking/jogging resting sessions in between.</p><p><br></p><h2>4) Run with the beat</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/4-run-with-the-beat.jpg' width='700' height='933' alt='Slightly older woman running while listening to music and holding an mp3 player in her hand.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Voila, this trick is quite effective when it comes to working out. Keep your headphones on while running. It is a human tendency that we match our footsteps with the beats of the music. Keep up with the tempo of the music. As the music goes slow, your speed goes slow and as the music beats pump, your speed increases too. Music helps in maintaining the flow and keep you running.</p><p><br></p><p>So just make your running playlist with whatever kind of music you prefer and get your kicks running. Music also fills you up with energy and keeps you boosted. Running with the music beats pumping is an implicit way of interval running. In a study conducted, people with the music turned on while running ran an extra mile as compared to people without the music beats on.</p><p><br></p><h2>5) Running Stairs</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/5-running-stairs.jpg' width='700' height='700' alt='Athletic, young man running up the stairs to increase performance, strength, speed  and stamina.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Well, it turns out that whenever you are running up the stairs you are indirectly doing a lot of plyometrics. Running up the stairs exerts maximum force to your body muscles. It\u2019s like doing cardio exercises along with lunges and squats. The best thing about this exercise is that; you train your hamstrings in a way that they are not generally used to.</p><p><br></p><p>Another benefit is that it increases your overall leg strength. It takes a lot of explosive power to speed up the stairs and you reach your AT (anaerobic threshold) quickly. Your body reaches to a point where it creates more lactic acid as compared to the quantity it can process. Training your body beyond anaerobic threshold improves your stamina and strength in an immense way than any other running exercise. <br></p><h2><br></h2><h2>6) Walking Lunges</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/6-walking-lunges.jpg' width='700' height='1050' alt='Young woman doing lunges while walking.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Walking lunges directly impact the thigh and leg muscles. They are great at improving the balance of the body posture. They also tone the hip muscles. Apart from all these, walking lunges improve the hip flexibility and make your thighs stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Stronger thighs directly impact the leg muscles strength. So indulging your body in exercising walking lunges before or after running will have a direct impact on speed and endurance as it will make your leg muscles stronger.</p><p><br></p><h2>7) Progressive Running workout</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/7-progressive-running-workout.jpg' width='700' height='495' alt='Creative of a man running fast with a progressive pace.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>It\u2019s simple: Start slow \u2013 Constantly increase your pace \u2013 Finish fast.<br>Just start your run at a normal slow pace but keep increasing it as you go further and aim to finish at a sprinting pace. Progressive runs like these indulge your body in a complete workout as they use both your anaerobic and aerobic systems. It also gives your body a recovery time as a normal running workout.</p><p><br></p><p>An example of progressive running workout would be \u2013 to run at an easy normal pace for approx 15 minutes followed by a hard pace comfortable run for another 15 minutes and then the next 15 minutes at an uncomfortable hard pace. The basic idea is to increment the running speed at every 15 minutes interval. <br></p><h2><br></h2><h2>8) The fartlek running</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/8-the-fartlek-running.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Sporty and determined woman running with varying speeds in a park, while dressed in sports outfit.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>The Swedish meaning of fartlek is \u201cspeed-play\u201d and that\u2019s the whole flavour of this workout \u2013 to play around with different distances and speed in one workout. The process of this workout is simple like intermixing slow and fast running and varying the distance and pace at each interval.</p><p><br></p><p>There are no rules to this workout and it can be as flexible as you want. Just randomly pick any place like a park or a street and then start sprinting for 2 minutes then slow pace running for 4 minutes or vice versa. Fartlek runs are very unstructured and unorganised. <br></p><p><br></p><p>These were all the running workouts that increase the speed and stamina of your running. There is more to building endurance like eating the proper food and indulging in workouts. To keep you on a good track there are some workouts and exercises that do wonders when it comes to building endurance and stamina. Some of them are:</p><h3><br>* Plyometrics</h3><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/plyometrics.jpg' width='700' height='1054' alt='Woman jumping high with a skipping rope, like in a froggy jump.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Plyometrics are basically the explosive workouts like jumping squats, jumping lunges, burpees and froggy jumps. Explosive cardiovascular workouts like these are the core to building a strong foundation to a muscular body. Workouts like these burn a lot of calories too. <br></p><p><br></p><h3>* Strength Training</h3><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/strength-training.jpg' width='700' height='1054' alt='Fit and healthy man doing weight training in a gym to increase strength, speed and stamina.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Of course you need strong legs to run a long distance. So, strength training is very vital to building endurance and stamina too. The core strength of the leg muscles really matters when it comes to running longer and better. Strong muscular legs increase power and it consequently leads to increased stamina and speed. <br></p><h3><br></h3><h3>* Proper Nutrition</h3><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/proper-nutrition.jpg' width='700' height='628' alt='Nutritious Food served in a plate: Colorful vegetables and chicken, rich in lean proteins, minerals, vitamins and carbohydrates; Required for building speed and stamina.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Taking a good diet is of utmost importance to building stamina and endurance. The food that you feed your body acts as the fuel to everything that follows be it a simple run or an aggressive workout. Make sure to take in good carbs and lean proteins.<br></p><h3><br></h3><h3>* Stretching</h3><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/stretching.jpg' width='700' height='1050' alt='Young and smiling woman stretching and warming up before a run, dressed in sports outfit.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Make it a golden rule of thumb: Never go running without doing a good warmup and cool down always after you have completed your workout. Stretching before starting your work out loosens up your muscles and increases the performance.<br>Happy running.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "c_header_mobile_image_name":"http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/mobile/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/fit-healthy-woman-sprinting-running-fast-for-long-distance-in-sports-outfit.jpg", "c_header_mobile_image_alt_desc":"\"Fit, healthy, young woman running fast and long distance on a road, dressed in sports outfit.\"", "c_header_mobile_image_path":"img/blog-img/default", "c_header_mobile_image_width":"450", "c_header_mobile_image_height":"467", "c_created_on":"2017-12-06 07:00:10", "c_summary":"Want to increase your running speed, endurance and stamina?

 {"c_id":7, "c_title":"Reasons: Why Running is Better Than Weight Training", "c_url_title":"why-running-better-than-weight-training", "c_category":"running", "c_template":"blog-profile", "c_mobile_body":"<p>There are a large number of reasons why you should go to the gym and indulge in strength training. For instance weight training is good when it comes to muscle building, core strength building and a good shape body. But when it comes to running it has a slight edge over strength training in some aspects which are common to everyone. In this article we have collected all those facts which will tell you why is it better to run than to indulge in strength training. Let us dive deep in and see what these facts have to offer.</p><p><br></p><p>Disclaimer: We are not asking you to stop going to the gym but we suggest that you should consider running too.<br></p><p><br></p><h2>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Running is free of equipments</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/1-running-is-free-of-equipments.jpg' width='700' height='1029' alt='Fit, healthy woman without equipment: running is equipment free.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>You don\u2019t need any dumbbells or machines to run. All you need is a good pair of running shoes and a sportswear and voila you are good to run. Running is low cost and highly productive in this sense. Running does not uphold us of any prerequisites of buying any equipment. Does it make you feel any better about hitting the park and running? If not, then give it a try and you will soon be in favour of it.</p><p><br></p><h2>2) Anywhere, anytime</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/2-anywhere-anytime.jpg' width='700' height='619' alt='Children running down hill on a lush green meadow.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>Oh-oh does the gym\u2019s opening time is 8:00 AM? Does your gym remains closed during the day time? Well running has an advantage here, parks remain open every time. Even if the park is closed you can hit any street corner and start your run there. Running does take you out of the gym walls and gets your kicks running. The other perk that running has to offer is the fresh breathe of nature that comes free of cost when you run.</p><p><br></p><h2>3) Running really lets you live longer</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/3-running-really-lets-you-live-longer.jpg' width='700' height='1050' alt='Senior man playing with his grand children, while the children are running in a park.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>Well this fact is research backed that runners really live longer than non-runners. There was a study conducted on approximately 1000 people and the study lasted for 21 years. The results of the study came out to be that the ratio of people alive after the age of 61 in terms of runners and non-runners was 85:66. This is a good enough reason to head out and run. The other noticeable point that came out after the study is that if you introduce running in your daily schedule then the chances of you living longer almost doubles up.</p><p><br></p><h2>4) Running makes you happy</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/4-running-makes-you-happy.jpg' width='700' height='873' alt='Happy and smiling woman running on a beach.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>This fact is also research backed that when we run our brain releases a chemical called endocannabinoid which is similar to the chemical released from cannabis plant. The simile that almost everyone uses in this context is by referring the \u2018after running happiness\u2019 to the \u2018runner\u2019s high\u2019. This chemical increases the dopamine release in your body (brain specifically) and dopamine release is the factor that makes us happy and feel delighted.</p><p><br></p><h2>5) Running cuts out on your travel time</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/5-running-cuts-out-on-your-travel-time.jpg' width='700' height='500' alt='People in cars stuck in traffic on the road.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>Well if you are headed for the gym then it might take you some time to reach the gym, but this is not the case in contrast to running. You just wear your kicks and directly head to run as soon as you get out of your residence. Rather than spending your time in the car travelling to the gym it is better to get out of your home and start running. So in a way it saves up your time of travel and increases your productivity.</p><p><br></p><h2>6) A good and fast way to reduce belly fat</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/6-a-good-and-fast-way-to-reduce-belly-fat.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Fat and heavy man and woman doing weight training.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>In a research conducted on runners it was found that people who ran more than 35 miles in a week had very less weight accumulation near the belly region. Running turns out to be better at avoiding belly fat as compared to any form of strength training. Running is also good for those looking to reduce belly fat fast. So next time you want to lose belly fat fast you know where to go.</p><p><br></p><h2>7) Running wins when it comes to burning calories</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/7-running-wins-when-it-comes-to-burning-calories.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Man running on pavement to burn fat and calories.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>A 60 minutes session of strength training burns approximately 299 calories whereas an hour of running burns approximately 550 calories. So clearly running is better at shedding calories as compared to strength training. Another fact to back up here:&nbsp; A treadmill set to \u2018hard level\u2019 burns approximately 800 calories in an hour which is far more than any of the strength training exercises. Weight training has an advantage at building core strength, so the best to do to yourself is to carry on with your strength training as well as add running to your daily schedule.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>8) You can take your dog along while running</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/8-you-can-take-your-dog-along-while-running.jpg' width='700' height='700' alt='Vector image of a woman running with her dog while the sun shines in the background.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>Dogs are generally not allowed at the gym but they are at the parks. So if you have to take your fur friend along head straight to the park. The good part is that while running a dog\u2019s body also releases endocannabinoid chemical similar to ours which is the reason behind us feeling happy. So help your dog friend and make them feel happy too. We guarantee that running with your pet alongside will be full of fun and enjoyment.</p><p><br></p><h2>9) Running is implicit cardiovascular workout</h2><p>When you run your heart beat starts to pump at a faster rate. Running covers up a lot of cardiovascular aspects. Running is one of the great ways to condition the cardiovascular body system. Running is an immense aerobic activity which rigorously utilises carbohydrates and fats and as a result the runner has high and quality oxygen consumption. A study from the past also reveals that the heart of a runner is more efficient than a sedentary person\u2019s heart. Along with cardiovascular conditioning running also tones and shapes up your body. Down the line running is implicitly doing cardio exercises without the need to pick up any weights.</p><p><br></p><h2>10) Running makes you goal oriented</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/10-running-makes-you-goal-oriented.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Goals are plotted on a board: focus is on top to achieve the goal' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br>We are our choices and choices have consequences. Psychology says that running makes us goal-focussed. You always aim to achieve higher levels while running and you have an idea in mind that these goals can\u2019t be achieved overnight. It takes hard work, consistent efforts and time to reach your running goals. So in a way running also impacts your attitude and gears you towards being persistent and patient. Mindset like this also pays off in other career choices in the long run. So, running makes you more focused, persistent and a goal oriented person in life.</p><p><br></p><h2>11) Running fights off immunity diseases</h2><p>Running makes your immune system stronger. In case you feel sick, then in that case a half-hour run can easily boost the immunity system to fight off low fever and common cold. In a study conducted people who were indulged in running for 5 days a week were found to be healthier than non runners and their chances of catching respiratory infections were found to be 45 percent lower than non runners. Running has an edge over any other workout involving weight training at making your immunity system stronger.</p><p><br></p><h2>12) Running offers more flexibility than weight training</h2><p><br>You don\u2019t have to be an athlete to start running, nor do you have to train your body for lifting heavy weights. You just grab your shoes and can directly head for a run. No complications. Also the running workout can be easily customised as per your routine and plans. Since running involves a lot of cardiovascular exercises being done implicitly, it is better than any other workout and makes your body muscles flexible.<br><br></p><h2>13) Running is more social</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/13-running-is-more-social.jpg' width='700' height='700' alt='Vector image of people running in a group and socializing. ' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br>Mostly everyone is involved in following their own workout schedule at the gym and we hardly notice people chit-chatting there. But running on the other hand is more of a community and social sport. You can easily find people on the running track and a lot of running communities out there on the internet to help you. Down the line running is more of a social sport as compared to gym workouts.</p><p><br></p><h2>14) Running is implicitly meditative in nature</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/14-running-is-implicitly-meditative-in-nature.jpg' width='700' height='465' alt='Calm and peaceful woman meditating on the beach with clear sky in the background.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br>Did you know that whenever you run you tend to encounter less negative thoughts than you usually would have? Aerobic activities like running release \u2018endorphin\u2019 in the brain and endorphins are known to make you more happy and energetic. Consequences or after effects like these are the essence of meditation. So, you can say running is kind of implicit meditation on the go.</p><p><br></p><h2>15) We are designed to run</h2><p><br>Running is actually the very basic form of exercise that we can do with our body parts. You just need your legs to push yourself forward and the best part is that running is as efficient as any other workout. As humans we have been lucky enough to be gifted with two legs and running can be one of the best return gifts that we can give back to our body.</p><p><br></p><h2>16) A good enough reason to eat carbohydrates</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/16-a-good-enough-reason-to-eat-carbohydrates.jpg' width='700' height='937' alt='Stack of white bread that is full of carbohydrates. ' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br>In a study conducted some time ago it was found that eating carbohydrates acted as a better fuel for runners to run better and more efficiently. Here we are talking about the carbohydrates that come from breads and pasta and not about the carbohydrates from multi grains. Eating carbohydrates makes a runner stay more energized in the long run. So you can easily munch on your favourite cookies and breads and stay guilt free at the same time. Voila, does this give you a good enough reason to run?</p><p><br></p><h2>17) Running improves your sleep quality</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/17-running-improves-your-sleep-quality.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Woman sleeping peacefully on her bed.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br>A simple and effective running habit to look after: Simply run for 30 minutes every day and continue this for three weeks and you will start to notice better sleep quality in no time. Psychology also says that if we want to make or convert something into a habit then we must do it every day for a period of 21 days and by default it will convert into a habit. Weight lifting and training drains out your energy after a while whereas a 30 minute consistent run will end making you feel happier and energetic. Looking at all the good effects running has to offer it really makes no sense for us to not make it a habit.</p><p><br></p><h2>18) Running makes your heart healthier</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/why-running-better-than-weight-training/18-running-makes-your-heart-healthier.jpg' width='700' height='495' alt='Animation of a heart running in a park' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br>Running is an exercise that not only affects just physical health during activity time but also after it is completed. It trains aerobic metabolism of the body, lowers resting heart rate, blood pressure and other physical metabolism of the body. As per a scientific study, running is the most effective form of exercise which also helps utilize time. Less time, more effectiveness and more productivity is considered to be the trademark of running as an exercise.</p><p><br></p><h2>19) Running turns out to be a good source of accessing vitamins</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Running is an outdoor activity and hence increases the exposure to sunlight whereas the gym walls devoid you of exposure to sunlight. Sunlight is a constant source of vitamin D which is considered very vital for human body. Taking a run outside also helps in maintaining mental health balance as it releases dopamine which helps in keeping depression away and preventing Type 2 Diabetes. Being a strenuous physical activity, it also helps strengthen your bones. So more reasons to keep running!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "c_header_mobile_image_name":"http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/mobile/why-running-better-than-weight-training/why-running-better-than-weight-training.jpg", "c_header_mobile_image_alt_desc":"\"Healthy, athletic man running on a bridge with green trees and plants in the background.\"", "c_header_mobile_image_path":"img/blog-img/default", "c_header_mobile_image_width":"520", "c_header_mobile_image_height":"293", "c_created_on":"2017-12-06 06:59:02", "c_summary":"Why running is better than Strength Training?

Astonishingly, they might not feel so bad from something that you did as from something that you didn\u2019t do. Treat your legs well in between runs to gain more enjoyment and fulfilment from your workout session, boost your performance, and speed up recovery time. &nbsp;So whether you are a pro or beginner, here are is everything you need to know about running. Let\u2019s get started.</p><p><br></p><h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don\u2019t miss out running even for a day</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/1-dont-miss-out-running-even-for-a-day.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Man in top of a turned down vehicle, try his best to get what he wants' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It\u2019s a very well known and a famous quote \u2013 \u201cPersistence is the key to success\u201d. Imagine it this way; 30 minutes of running a day for 30 days equals 900 minutes of total running a month, and 900 minutes of running not only sounds behemoth but also has amazing effects on the body. &nbsp;A regular and continuous running schedule helps to improve your body\u2019s ability to burn more calories along with your biomechanics. It also trains your mind to endure through any kind of challenge, be of any kind physical or mental. If you stay persistent at following your running schedule then you will surely notice the difference in no time.</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Invest in comfort</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/2-invest-in-comfort.jpg' width='700' height='1087' alt='Smiling, sporty woman feeling comfortable in her sports outfit' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>\u201cNo pain, no gain\u201d sounds only good to hear. In reality, studies have shown that the more comfortable you feel, much easier it\u2019ll be for you to last long during your workout. Buy a good fit running outfit, body glide balm and sport socks. Nothing can kill a run like a blister about to pop. Track the miles on your shoes. At about 250 miles, mid-soles can become too compressed to get back to their original form between runs, and your feet and ankles will begin to notice. That\u2019s why be sure to replace your shoes at regular intervals.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>3. Give yourself a solid reason</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/3-give-yourself-a-solid-reason.jpg' width='700' height='700' alt='Creative: silhouette of a running woman with reason and message as: Winners never quit and quitters never win' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p>For whatever action we do, when we have a strong motivation inside us then it becomes incredibly easily to implement the action. For instance, I started as a team in training charity marathons, having lost my loved one to breast cancer. When I am struggling with my training schedules, I recollect in my mind those people who are still fighting their battles, those who have survived in the part because of the money raised and those people who have been taken away from us. Things like these boost my adrenaline and keep me pumped up and motivated.</p><p><br></p><h2>4. Collaboration is the secret to great running</h2><p><br></p><p>Of course we learn a lot from people around us and we are actually the sum of 5 people we spend most of our time with. Hang around those who are serious about running, and in that way you will be able to pick up a few titbits \u2013 how to set pace for yourself, which routes have the most hygienic restrooms, what cloth to wear when the weather is changing more rapidly than a facebook feed. We asked trainers, nutritionists, coaches and veteran athletes to share their strategies. Just steal them to be able to run longer, feel lighter and stay accident-free.</p><p><br></p><h2>5. Stay positive</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/5-stay-positive.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Smiling woman with positive attitude while showing thumps up' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>From the words of Buddha \u2013 \u201cWhat you think is what you become\u201d. The mantra of being able to have a positive attitude works in all kind of situations in life and running being no exception. Finish runs feeling strong and joyful, not worn-out. It will keep you coming back again for more and help you reduce injuries in sports.</p><p><br></p><h2>6. Find the sweet spot for you</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is really helpful to write down your workouts throughout the week, and then you can colour-code them in a way they make you feel. For example, Yellow for \u2018amazing\u2019, orange for \u2018Just OK\u2019 and red may be \u2018Really bad workout\u2019. It is a nice visual way of seeing how your body reacts and it will immensely help you to pick up the most suitable words for you. Like, if you are always orange or may be red around your streak, then it is a sign that you should be doing lighter workouts on such days.</p><p><br></p><h2>7. Layer less</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is always an advisable practice to dress to run like it is 10 to 15 degrees warmer than it is. As soon you go out in the open and get to moving, your body will get all warmed and heated up well and you will be glad that you did not put so many layers.</p><p><br></p><h2>8. Stay away from parties, alcohol specifically</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/8-stay-away-from-parties-alcohol-specifically.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Glasses hanging from a stand in a bar with bright party lights in the background.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Please don\u2019t let your long lasting hard work get destroyed by snacks and beer at late night parties. Steer clear of happy hour the day or two before your running or training session. The munchies that you eat while having alcohol especially beer are the \u2018weight-increasers\u2019. Alcohol is known to significantly affect sleep quality and hydration levels, as well the post recovery of the body. With alcohol everything goes down the drain, so stay away from alcohol. If you have to indulge in consuming alcohol then make sure to consume it in moderate amounts.</p><h2>9. Be smart in training</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to get yourself stronger, your body needs proper time to rebuild. Try to mix easy days with tough ones, and also avoid pushing when the body signals for a break. It\u2019s not at all good practice to keep straining your body beyond your limits. The better way to train your body is by \u2018gradual training\u2019 and not \u2018all at once\u2019. In that way you will see a drastic improvement over the course of time and it also reduces the risk of injury.</p><p><br></p><h2>10. Down a cup of coffee</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/10-down-a-cup-of-coffee.jpg' width='700' height='878' alt='Woman drinking coffee while holding the cup in hand' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Here is the good news - having caffeine before the workout has been linked to make running much easier and helps the body burn fats more efficiently. Try to aim for about 4 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight. For a 150 pound woman, that\u2019s would be like in a 18-ounce coffee. So don\u2019t forget your coffee before heading for your next run.</p><p><br></p><h2>11. Socialise your running</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/11-socialise-your-running.jpg' width='700' height='800' alt='People running together in a park' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Running may seem like a solitary pursuit, but there is a great amount of benefits to making a connection with others- and no better way to do that than by running with a group. There are many websites like meetup.com, thepecul.com which can help you in finding a local group with same interest. Or perhaps you just stop at your local running store and make new friends with same passion for running.</p><p><br></p><h2>12. Brag to others about your running</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Psychology says that when we brag about something then we start holding ourselves responsible for the non-commitment of that act in the future. We must admit that we all love to brag about our good stuff, so why leave running behind? Shout out to people when you reach your workout goals. Share it on your social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and twitter. Call your buddies. And now there are so many applications like runtastic, runkeeper, Nike plus so on and so forth so that you can accurately track your miles and even share on various social media platforms. Bragging about running sounds a bit idiosyncratic but somewhere down the line it helps.</p><p><br></p><h2>13. Mind the incline</h2><p><br></p><p>This point holds accountable especially for beginners i.e. when you are just getting started for running then you should avoids difficult terrains. Never accelerate down the hill. The shattering forces on your body can destroy your ankle and knees. This may not only affect your body but also mind by demeaning you and thus you will finally give up all over on running. So be gradual in practice, initially avoid difficult tracks. Remember the saying, \u201cPatience is the fastest path to success.\u201d Once you get hold of it then follow difficult terrains.</p><p><br></p><h2>14. Don\u2019t even think about others</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You don\u2019t need to compare yourself to become a better runner. Everyone has their own capabilities and learning curve. Just compare your progress with yourself. There will always be someone faster and leaner and who will seem more like a runner than you do. The key to success is to focus on your own improvements that you want to make for yourself. Keeping a track on your set of goals over the months can be really motivating and helpful in long run.</p><p><br></p><h2>15. Fuel yourself properly</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you have eaten a large meal before your running session, then wait at least two to three hours before you head out. Almost anything you eat immediately before a workout will digest enough to provide you energy during your sprint. If you still have to eat, choose something your body can easily digest, that can be a banana, a few handful of peanut butter or honey, or may be few grams of almonds.</p><p><br></p><h2>16. Keep hydrating yourself</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/16-keep-hydrating-yourself.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Sports woman drinking water to keep herself hydrated' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is so common yet most neglected by beginners. It\u2019s highly recommended to drink at least eight glasses of water an hour before going out for running session in order to prevent dehydration. If you are going for a longer workout let's say like 10k, then you might consider taking a water bottle or perhaps planning a route that has a water stop along the way. Staying hydrated will definitely keep your legs from cramping, especially in summer time. Dehydration can have worse effects on your body like you may get fainted and a black-out feeling.</p><p><br></p><h2>17. Learning to cool down:</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>After you complete your miles, don\u2019t forget to do a two to five minutes cool easy down run, then stretch your body thoroughly. Don\u2019t just immediately jump back into your car and go off to your next event, this may lead you to walking around with tight legs for the rest of the day. Doing a bit of cool down and stretching period allows the lactic acid (it is the bi-product created by leg\u2019s muscles) to be drained out into your bloodstream and eliminate from your body. Also taking a hot bath or just relaxing in a hot bath tub after your workout can be really relaxing for your muscles. You can also pamper your body by taking a good massage.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "c_header_mobile_image_name":"http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/mobile/running-tips-must-know/essentials-running-tips-that-will-keep-you-going.jpg", "c_header_mobile_image_alt_desc":"\"Two woman running and going along while looking and smiling at each other\"", "c_header_mobile_image_path":"img/blog-img/default", "c_header_mobile_image_width":"520", "c_header_mobile_image_height":"607", "c_created_on":"2017-12-06 06:58:30", "c_summary":"Running is an amazing workout, however there are few important things that you must know.

Use an all natural diet to become healthy and active. Eating moderate portions of whole and unprocessed food can contribute well to your heart and muscles. Consume only those food items which help you fuel up your daily functions. This way you feel fatigueless and more energetic throughout the day.</p><p><br></p><h2>1. Intake of proteins</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/1-intake-of-proteins.jpg' width='700' height='937' alt='Man preparing a protein rich diet (eggs, sausages, etc.) in a frying pan.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Proteins are vital for building lean muscle mass. Having protein in your diet after workout help your body in rebuilding muscles. Building muscle mass through diet boosts your metabolism. It also turns body fat to lean mass, thus, makes your over all body composition healthier than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Proteins prove to be very helpful in losing fat. They contribute in making your tummy feel full. So, you tend to crave less for more food. Consuming adequate protein burns body fat as it demands more calories to digest it. Thus, it helps in losing fat faster while maintain muscle mass.</p><p><br></p><p>Appropriate non vegetarian high protein food: Chicken, lean mutton, salmon fish, tuna fish and eggs.</p><p><br></p><p>Vegetarian high protein food: Broccoli, mustard greens, soybeans, leafy greens and peanut butter.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>2. Eat less Carbohydrates</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/2-eat-less-carbohydrates.jpg' width='700' height='700' alt='A single banana showing less carbohydrates.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Cutting carbohydrates from your regular diet is one of the best ways to lose weight. Consuming less carbohydrate tends to reduce your appetite. Thus, you keep losing weight automatically. Moreover, carbohydrates help your body absorb proteins which does not let it turn into fat and gain weight.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It is recommended that carbohydrates should be consumed before workout as they give instant energy to burn calories. This way, carbohydrates contribute a lot to workout routine and diet, if consumed properly.</p><p><br></p><p>Appropriate carbohydrates for body building: Whole grain bread, pasta and rice. These food items also reduce high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Oatmeal and sweet potatoes are also considered as the best source of carbohydrates.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>3. Count your calories</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/3-count-your-calories.jpg' width='700' height='578' alt='Women counting calories on her phone while all the food items are placed in front of her on a table.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Your calorie intake plays a very important role in body building. You cannot fill your stomach with unhealthy food or large meals 1-2 times in a day. This will lead to other abnormal weight problems. Balancing your calories is important as too many calories may lead to weight gain and too few calories can result in no muscle mass. It is always recommended to eat more calories than your body burns off during workout and all day long.</p><p><br></p><p>Eat high quality protein, nutritious meals and natural food atleast 6 times a day. Use fresh vegetables, fruits and whole grains in place of processed food made with refine sugar and grains. High fiber food promotes fat loss and keeps your tummy full for long time. Focus on high quality protein as it helps in repair and growth of muscles.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>4. No to \u2018Processed Food\u2019</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/4-no-to-processed-food.jpg' width='700' height='562' alt='Vector image of a can of processed food.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>It is rightly being said, <em>\u201cThe key to healthy eating is avoid any food that has a TV Commercial.\u201d</em></p><p><br></p><p>Processed food is the enemy of a healthy body. They are high in preservatives and flavours with almost zero nutrition value. The unhealthiest facts of processed food are the artificial sweeteners and synthetic vitamins that gradually make the body go weak.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Immediately stop consuming food products like packed chips and cookies, frozen or instant made food, artificial drinks or juices and packed chicken or meat.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Cardiovascular Exercises</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/cardiovascular-exercises.jpg' width='700' height='393' alt='People in gym doing aerobics and other cardiovascular exercises.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate goal to build a fit body is to lose fat while maintaining good amount of muscle you have. Cardiovascular exercises mainly demand more calories which increases fat loss. While doing cardio training, a lot of people lose muscle mass with fat. This is only for the reason they lose calories more than their body intake. So it is important to set out a strict routine to balance your cardio and weight training.</p><p>To carve a great physique, it is important to properly pair your cardio training with weight training. For example, do low intensity cardio for 30 minutes preceded by 45-60 minutes weight training.

It involves great training ambitions and nutrition strategy together. Make weight training a regular part of your workout. It not only builds muscles but also tones your body in proper shape.</p><p>For building muscles, you need to improve your strength and define your body. You can divide your muscle building and weight training program in to three phases. These are \u2013 Building base, Hypertrophy and Tone your body.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>1.Building Base</h2><p><br></p><p>Building Base is just like building the foundation of your resistance training program. In this phase, you work for building strength, endurance and stability of joints. The most effective part of this phase is circuit training. It uses high intensity aerobics as well as muscular training. Make a circuit of exercises and on the completion of that circuit; begin again with the same circuit. Exercises included in a circuit should work on each body part individually. &nbsp;Try to lift moderate weights in this phase.</p><p><br></p><p>For upper body, include exercises like squat ups, bench dips, Back extensions, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>For lower body, the most effective exercises are squat jumps, compass jumps, step ups, bench squats and hopping shuttles.</p><p><br></p><p>For core &amp; trunk, exercises like Sit ups, stomach crunch and back extension chest raise are the best.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Hypertrophy</h2><p><br></p><p>Once you have built the foundation of your training program, it is time to challenge the muscles to grow. Hypertrophy induces the fastest muscle growth. This is the phase where people actually transform their body and improve their physique. Hypertrophy also results in producing more hormones which loses body fat and fosters muscle growth.</p><p><br></p><p>For better results, use challenging weights that make every last repetition difficult.</p><p><br></p><h2>3. Tone your Body</h2><p><br></p><p>After building a strong foundation and adding muscle mass, there comes the time to tone your body. Toning your body means firming up each part of the body. In this phase, lift heavier weights that challenge the final repetition. Design this phase in a vertical format by adding exercise one after the other. Complete all sets of exercises, take rest for 60-120 seconds and then start again from the top.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>Follow natural diet; make your cardio a routine and weight training a part of your lifestyle.

If your body does not allow or your legs feel painful then avoid it.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>16) Follow the Nike motto: Just Do It.</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/16-follow-the-nike-motto-just-do-it.jpg' width='700' height='454' alt='Vector image of a man in action and sprinting hard to reach his goal.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This point is self explanatory. Don\u2019t miss out on your running schedule. Just do it every day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>17) Make it playful.</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don\u2019t do it because you have to do it, instead do it because it is fun.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>18) The hidden treasure</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>All the warm ups that you do before running burn approximately 100 calories. It doesn\u2019t sound much but it really adds up in the long run.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>19) Don\u2019t repeat mistakes</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The optimum level of exercising is different for different individuals. If you feel pain then avoid running the next day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>20) Try different running styles</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/20-try-different-running-styles.jpg' width='700' height='556' alt='Vector image of people running with different hand, leg and body movement.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>To make it playful, try to run with different running styles every day like jogging on Mondays, sprinting on Tuesdays, pace running on Wednesday and so on.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>21) Avoid fats</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/21-avoid-fats.jpg' width='700' height='474' alt='A fat man binging of fatty food.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Excessive intake of everything is bad. Just don\u2019t consume fats in large quantities as fats slow down the process of digestion.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>22) Make goals</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Making running goals before leaving you house is a good way to stay motivated. These can be like: running 2 miles and jogging 1 mile and so on.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>23) Plan it accordingly</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/23-plan-it-accordingly.jpg' width='700' height='972' alt='Woman writing with a pen in a notebook: Depicting writing down a plan in diary.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Psychology says that we do things in a better way when we write them down somewhere. This principle can be applied here as well. Track your run and match it with the limit specified by you.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>24) Be consistent</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Running at a slow pace and consistently is better than sprinting fast and then sweating to finish.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>25) Mix and match things</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Add variety to your run. It can be like running for a minute and then jogging for 2 minutes and then sprinting for 1 minute.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>26) Focus on the bigger picture</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/26-focus-on-the-bigger-picture.jpg' width='700' height='465' alt='Sports woman skidding with focus and eyes on the target.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Rather than focusing on the style of your run, focus on the gain which is endurance.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>27) Throw away the clutter</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There is loads of information on the internet: run this time, run that way, run like this and blah-blah-blah. Just run how you want to.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>28) Let the beats on</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Our feet try to match up with the music being played. So just turn on the playlist that you like and get your kicks running.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>29) Just keep going</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/29-just-keep-going.jpg' width='700' height='416' alt='Business man in going and almost running to keep up with his schedule.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It\u2019s okay if you had a bad day and could not complete the target set by you, but remember \u201cEvery day is a new day\u201d. So make sure to get it done the next day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>30) Run quality</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There\u2019s no hard and fast rule to running. But make sure to run quality miles. For instance, if you run 35 miles a week then about 8 of those should be quality. It will also boost your body\u2019s aerobic capacity.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>31) Keep the boredom at bay</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Doing same things everyday can turn out to be a bit boring. So you can jazz up your running time, style and routine a little.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>32) Try cross eating</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/32-try-cross-eating.jpg' width='700' height='604' alt='Blue berries in a bowl: depicting different food than usual.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Cross eating simply means adding variety to your diet. A good approach to this is to add a new food every Sunday. This approach really expands your nutritional range.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>33) Relax a bit after running</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/33-relax-a-bit-after-running.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Woman outdoor, feeling happy and relaxed with her arms raised.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>After your run is complete just take a few moments to relax, calm down and stretch. Avoid rushing back to the busy life after that.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>34) Take it easy</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Aggressive stretching after running may lead to increased injury risk. So just take it calmly.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>35) Think big, start small</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Just keep in mind the big picture but act on weekly basis to achieve that. For example plan the running schedule for the next 12 days but have in mind how will things change after a span of 3 months. I think that\u2019s a great way to stay motivated.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>36) Don\u2019t just hit the rock bottom</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The thing that differentiates good runners to average runners is persistence. Anyone can train themselves into the ground but greatness lies in doing something that makes you stronger every passing day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>37) Be in the moment</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/37-be-in-the-moment.jpg' width='700' height='423' alt='Relaxed man lying peacefully with his back on the grass, listening to music with eyes closed while just being with himself.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Don\u2019t forget to smell the flowers and hear the birds chirruping during your morning run. This will really make your morning run awesome.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>38) Go with an open mind</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Whenever you approach a new workout or running technique just go on with it like a beginner.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>39) Try Fartlek Runs</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Fartlek runs basically mean \u201cspeed play\u201d. Just play around with different speed and styles during your run.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>40) Act smart</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Place the energy drinks or container bottles filled with water on your running track. This trick is useful when you are aiming for a long run.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>41) Work on intensity</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It\u2019s said that a long run puts a \u201cbeast\u201d in a \u201cperson\u201d.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>42) Don\u2019t keep an eye on the watch</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/42-dont-keep-an-eye-on-the-watch.jpg' width='700' height='436' alt='Man checking time on his watch while running.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The best way to do it is to avoid wearing a watch when you go running. It is sometimes better not to compare time from day to day.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>43) Take rest</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Suppose you work out for 5 days, then make sure to take rest for next 2 days. This will keep your body injury free.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>44) Pick and roll</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Just pick on one thing every month that you need to work on and then act. It is quite difficult to work on everything all at once.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>45) Try the resistance running</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/45-try-the-resistance-running.jpg' width='700' height='553' alt='Vector image of a man running up hill.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>By this we mean \u201crun to the hills\u201d. Hill running will also make your leg muscles stronger.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>46) Include workouts with your run</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Adding chest and legs workout along with your run is a great way to boost endurance.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>47) Adapt</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Running up the hills puts force on your leg and thigh muscles and in turn makes you stronger. Your muscles learn to adapt to new and increasing stress.</p><p><br></p><h2>48) Avoid running downside</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There is no added advantage to running down the hills. Half of the work gets done on its own and it exerts very less force on the legs.</p><p><br></p><h2>49) Invest in a treadmill if hills are far off</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/49-invest-in-a-treadmill-if-hills-are-far-off.jpg' width='700' height='1022' alt='People running on a treadmill in a gym.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>These days treadmills come with a incline up technology where you can increase the inclined-running angle. This is a good alternative to upside hill running.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>50) Try the tempo runs</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Tempo runs range for a shorter distance but they are generally at higher pace than the normal. They are the key to improving speed and stamina.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>51) Imagination makes things easy</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you are having difficulty running up the hill then imaging then a rope is tied to your waste which is pulling you upwards.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>52) Save energy for the top</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It\u2019s better to start running from somewhere in between the hill road so that you can complete till the summit.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>53) Eat Healthy</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The food that you feed to your body acts as the fuel for further mechanisms. A diet with balanced amount of proteins, carbohydrates and other nutrients will keep your body in great shape all the time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>54) Switch between running and jogging</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Switching between running and jogging will improve your body\u2019s stamina and will give you a variety run.</p><p><br></p><h2>55) Keep increasing everyday</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Just make sure to increase your running speed every day. This will help you build endurance. If that seems difficult you can also increase your running time.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>56) Quality matters</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you stay in your comfort zone and never do the exercises or runs which seem difficult then it is not going to get great things done for you. Instead challenge yourself and it will be fun.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>57) Stay informed</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Stay informed about the weather conditions, the run tracks and most important your fitness levels.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>58) Flexibility adds to the core</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If your body is flexible then it really matters. It will reduce the chances of injury and help you run better.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>59) Get over with it</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you had a bad run or a bad workout day then simply sweat it out for 30 minutes and get going.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>60) Pass by the other runners</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Passing by the other runners while completing your run is studied to give you an adrenaline rush and help you stay motivated.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>61) Stay Patient</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You have to wait for 7-8 successful track runs to see the results. So be patient for that time period.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>62) Check your pulse</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Just check the pulse rate. If it is above 10 than average then you need to rest as you have not recovered from the earlier day\u2019s session training.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>63) Run long</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The idea behind is simple: \u201cRun further\u201d. Just keep on increasing your running distance by 0.3 miles every day. This is not much, but it really adds up in the long run.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>64) Tie it properly</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is annoying to stop in the middle of the race to tie your shoe lace. So just double tie them before you start your run.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>65) Observe</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Once you get hold of the warmup and stretching routine that works best for you then follow it. Try repeating it as a daily ritual.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>66) Wearing the perfect pairs</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Studies say that wearing shoes that are feather-lite help you to run further. So light weight shoes are better when it comes to running long distances.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>67) Finish fast</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/67-finish-fast.jpg' width='700' height='471' alt='Man finishing race while other people follow in order to finish fast.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Whether you start your run with a slow jog or a fat paced jog, complete your run at a speed faster than at which you initiated.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>68) Persistence matters</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is okay to start at a pace which is slow than to run too fast and then starving to oxygen debt. Just be consistent at the running pace.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>69) Don\u2019t miss out</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If everything is perfect and your body allows too then do not miss out on the routine of running. If you do then have a backup plan to cover it up.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>70) Interval Training</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sprint for 30 seconds and then slow down to a speed approximately 75% of your sprint pace and then continuing at that speed for another 3-4 minutes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>71) Go Minimal</h3><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Run for about 25minutes three times in a week and then increase the third week run\u2019s length.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>72) Build it gradually</h3><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Rather than slow jogging today and immediately sprinting tomorrow, it is better to build upon speed in a gradual way.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>73) Do not push it too further</h3><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is said that 2.5 hours slow run is better than 2 hours of sprinting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>74) Do progressive runs</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The principle behind is simple: Start at a slow pace \u2013 Constantly increase your pace \u2013 Finish sprinting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>75) Keep an eye for this</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Whenever you are in the \u201chard training session\u201d feel free to keep a day off for rest. The other thing to watch out or is to never run for more than 3 hours straight.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>76) Feather-bed you muscles</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/76-feather-bed-you-muscles.jpg' width='700' height='1014' alt='Back of a man being massaged by a women while he is lying on his abdomen.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you are going under a hard training then soak in a hot bath sometimes and get your muscles massaged on a weekly basis. Of course it is your body, you can pamper it.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>77) Go for diet that is iron rich</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Iron and Vitamin C are a good way to keep anaemia at bay. Iron will also give you good amount of energy needed for training.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>78) Include weights</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You can wear ankle weights while running. This makes it easy for you to run when you run without them, so in a way you train in a hard way.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>79) Go Plyometrics</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Plyometrics are the explosive workouts like Froggy jumps, jumping squats and so on. They are the core to building muscular body.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>80) Divide into groups of three</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Divide your run into threes: Running the first one with your head, the second with your personality, and the last with your heart \u2013 Mike Fanelli.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>81) Don\u2019t rush</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Just because you have practiced so much on your running style you will have an edge over the other runners. So take it easy and show it when the right time comes.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>82) Walk before you run</h2><p><br>It is like a phrase being used \u2013 \u201cgo easy and then go hard\u201d. This way you will not feel out of breath and will have developed a good stamina in the long run.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>83) Being a copycat helps sometimes</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you visualise how your run is going to be then the whole process of running becomes easy. If you role model someone who is calm and composed then it will have a good impact on your run too.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>84) Stay positive</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you have a calm attitude towards your running psych then it will surely help you. From the words of Buddha \u2013 \u201cWhat you think is what you become\u201d is what I am trying to talk in here. So keeping a positive attitude will reflect in your workout as well.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>85) Comfort investing</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Investing in clothes and footwear that feel comfortable is always a win-win.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>86) Avoid alcohol</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/86-avoid-alcohol.jpg' width='700' height='390' alt='Wine bottles with glasses filled with wine placed by the side of each bottle.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Avoid taking alcohol if possible or else you can indulge in taking moderate amounts of alcohol. The munchies that we tend to consume when having alcohol is also one of the prominent factors of weight increase.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>87) Be a smart trainer</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>By smart training I mean making a proper schedule of time, days and the rest days based on your training. Working out based on schedule also gives you a sense of completion.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>88) Make use of technology</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/88-make-use-of-technology.jpg' width='700' height='700' alt='Creative of a man using a mobile phone, and smart watch: Depicting the use of technology.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>These days the mobile phone application stores are filled with a ton of fitness apps. You can probably use one of them which sets your running schedule. The one which I know of and is great is Nike+ training application.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>89) Have a cup of coffee</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/89-have-a-cup-of-coffee.jpg' width='700' height='400' alt='A cup filled with coffee placed on a notebook on a table.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is one of the common advices that we get \u2013 to have a cup of coffee before starting your physical workout. Just make sure to consume it in moderate amounts.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>90) Try socialising</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/90-try-socialising.jpg' width='700' height='352' alt='Women in group cheering and enjoying in a park on a bright sunny day.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Another way to stay motivated is to run with a group of people. Try searching for a running group that is nearby the area you live or else you can find them on the internet.</p><p><br></p><h2><br></h2><h2>91) Try meditating</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/91-try-meditating.jpg' width='700' height='586' alt='Close up of a woman meditating while sitting on the floor, with green background.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Mediation is known to have a positive effect on our body.

Improves respiration, muscular flexibility and also makes you feel fresh.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>93) Heavy weight lifting</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-101/93-heavy-weight-lifting.jpg' width='700' height='364' alt='Man lifting heavy weights in a gym.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Try explosive workouts which include heavy weights. Workouts like these strengthen the core.

Luckily, there are so many methods and tricks to go about it and running being one of them.</p><p><br></p><p>But the important question is: What exactly is the best way to go about reaching an optimal weight loss? So we did some soul searching over the internet and met a few running experts to gain accurate knowledge over the subject.</p><p><br></p><p>To keep things simple and informational we have put together a list of all the running tips and tricks to boost your weight loss process. And here we go!</p><p><br></p><h2>1) Run regularly</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-to-boost-weight-loss/1-run-regularly.jpg' width='700' height='585' alt='Vector image of a man running.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p>It is advised that you should start out running sessions at least three times a week and then gradually increase the practice to four or five times a week.</p><p><br></p><p>Generally, the more you are able to work out, the better will be the results, but it is really important to make sure that you care and listen to your body. If the body signals that you need a break, then you should just take it. If you don\u2019t listen to your body, this will lead to serious injuries.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>2) Bring strength training into main focus&nbsp;</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-to-boost-weight-loss/2-bring-strength-training-into-main-focus.jpg' width='700' height='432' alt='Close up of the back side of a man doing strength training.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p>It\u2019s unfortunate that it is really hard to reach your weight loss goals with running sessions alone. Studies tell that higher the amount of muscles in your body, higher your basal metabolic rate will be.</p><p><br></p><p>Hence, in addition to your running training you should also try to include at least one or two strength training workouts per week either with your own body weight or you can also use free weights. There are also wide apps available that will help you to maximize strength training practice with running.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>3) Mix up your training sessions</h2><p><br></p><p>At first, any beginner can achieve good results with short and easy runs. However, with time your body will quickly adapt to this training stimulus and build up reserves. This presents a big problem for more experienced runners; over the time period the fat burning gains will grow more and more small.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In order to avoid this situation, you need to incorporate as much variety as you can in your workout sessions. \u201cDon\u2019t give your body the chance to get used to your flow of workouts,\u201d said Sascha, a well known running coach in America. By switching your training, you force your body to adaptation. This, in turn, will help you to improve your performance and boosts your metabolism.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Make variety a part of your routine and in addition to the long-distances runs, work in some intervals, sprints, technique drilling and strength training. A good rule of thumb often advised is never to do the same workout twice back to back.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>4) Gradually increase your intensity</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-to-boost-weight-loss/4-gradually-increase-your-intensity.jpg' width='700' height='428' alt='Icon of a man running with an up arrow in front: depicting increasing intensity.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>\u201cAn engine that is running at full speed burns a lot of fuel!\u201d This is a very good way to picture the fat burning mechanism of your body during the intense running session. A strenuous interval workout session requires a lot of energy.</p><p><br></p><p>While at the same time it is true that the amount of fat burned in the metabolic process is quite high during the slow runs, but the total daily energy expenditure, and hence the number of calories burned, is comparatively low due to the low intensity of the session.</p><p><br></p><p>On the other hand, in case of high intensity workouts, like intervals, the amount of fat burned in the metabolic process is significantly lower, but at the same time the total daily energy expenditure and the calories burned are many folds higher. Furthermore, the \u201cafter burn\u201d effect is much higher during the recovery period from a higher intensity workout than a lower one. For all these reasons, you shouldn\u2019t do more than one in a week.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>5) Don\u2019t forget to give yourself timely breaks</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-to-boost-weight-loss/5-dont-forget-to-give-yourself-timely-breaks.jpg' width='700' height='525' alt='Woman relaxing with eyes closed in a bath tub with candles placed around the tub.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Your body needs some time in order to adapt to all the different training stimuli. Thus, give yourself at least one or two day rest per week. Also, make sure that you get sufficient sleep. This influences all kinds of metabolic processes in your body. Also, take walks in between your running because it not only helps your muscles to cool down but also increases your endurance and stamina in the long run.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cWalking helps in reducing the impact force on the muscles, tendons and joints and also reduces the breathing rate and heart rate,\u201d says running coach John Hadfield, co author of Marathoning for mortals and the founder at coach-john.com. Taking walk breaks also helps in lowering the impact on the body, which may prevent cramping and soaring of the muscles. During your weekend running session, so a brisk walk for 30 to 60 seconds after every 2 kilometre, no matter the total distance, says John.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>6) Don\u2019t just cut too many calories</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-to-boost-weight-loss/6-dont-just-cut-too-many-calories.jpg' width='700' height='465' alt='Woman drinking juice and feeling energetic by flexing her arms.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>When it comes down to weight loss, runners should think of calories in terms of energy. If you don\u2019t take in sufficient amount of calories, you won\u2019t get the required amount of energy to fuel your workout properly. This means that you will probably end up burning fewer calories.</p><p><br></p><p>\u201cIf you are eating right amount for your sport, you will be able to lose the excess weight in a healthy way without experiencing fatigue and poor workouts\u201d. It is not at all about the deprivation. If you are really eating for energy, the weight will surely come out.</p><p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>7) Time your meals</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It\u2019s very important for athletes to properly schedule their diet in order to best fuel the muscles. If your workouts are in the morning time, your dinner surely shouldn\u2019t be your biggest food meal.</p><p><br></p><p>Make sure that you are getting sufficient amount of carbohydrates before your workout and a have good enough recovery snacks that contains carbohydrates and a little bit of protein, like fat-free chocolate powdered milk or, in case if you are a vegan, then you can use soya milk or may be almond milk, a banana and a small scoop of plant based protein with some ice inside the blender.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>8) Plan ahead</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-to-boost-weight-loss/8-plan-ahead.jpg' width='700' height='467' alt='Woman placing sticky notes on a glass wall and planning for the future.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>When you are planning out your meals for the week, you are more likely to stay on the track of healthy eating routine. Planning and then sticking to a routine is really helpful in removing most of the chatter involved in making food decisions.</p><p><br></p><p>It also eliminates the risk of eating impulsive foods out of craving that almost in all circumstances affect blood sugar levels and makes us the only victim of food craving and grazing.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>9) Hit the hills</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-to-boost-weight-loss/9-hit-the-hills.jpg' width='700' height='782' alt='Slim and fit woman running in the hills.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>If you are used to doing running on the flat ground, then hitting the hills will definitely help you burn more calories. For each and every degree of incline, you get about a 10-20 percent increase in total calories burnt, so a mild hill running session will likely burn about 60 percent more fat. Run up the hill at a high speed for 10-30 seconds, then jog back down and take a 40-60 second rest.</p><p><br></p><p>Repeat this training 4-10 times or as your body allows. If you are in the gym, then set the treadmill to a 10-12 percent incline for the run. Not only is this going to be really helpful in burning more calories. Running on the hills is also likely to shape and tone your body.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>10) Step it up</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>So now you have hit the hills, but now you are eyeing for some new challenge? Perhaps it is time to take it to the stairs. Stair running has been known as one of the best and most effectively proven method for fast calories burning and the overall conditioning exercise you can do.</p><p><br></p><p>It\u2019s indeed pretty simple as well: run up the stairs and then do a mild-jog/ trot back down to recover. Obviously you need to be very careful while doing this exercise. If you were thinking that hill run was tough, then this exercise will kick your butt.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>11) Nutrition, recovery and after burn effect</h2><p><br></p><p>If you are really interested in burning fat during running sessions, you need to make sure that your body should burn more calories per day than it intakes. Running experts often explain that \u201cit highly depends on a good ratio of exercise and a healthy diet.\u201d</p><p><br></p><p>If you only focus on only one of the factors, it is definitely going to be quite hard to achieve or sustain your balanced weight.</p><p><br></p><p>Sportsperson often consume a lot of carbohydrates to build up glycogen stores in their muscles. \u201cGenerally speaking, this is vital for your body\u2019s ability to perform physical exercise.\u201d But, the consumption of carbohydrates can also interfere with the metabolism mechanism of fats.</p><p><br></p><p>Consequently, if you want to decrease your fat stores, you shouldn\u2019t drink or eat anything that contains sugar post your workout. Your body must learn to recover after your workout.</p><p><br></p><p>This is known as the\u201dafter burn\u201d effect. This effect is especially seen highest after interval training or intensive strength training.</p><p><br></p><p>Bottom line from experts: \u201cThe best way and most tested way to lose weight is a combination of running, intense strength training and balanced nutrition.\u201d So get out there and test the running expert\u2019s tips to enhance your weight loss!</p><p><br><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>", "c_header_mobile_image_name":"http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/mobile/running-tips-to-boost-weight-loss/running-tips-to-boost-weight-loss.jpg", "c_header_mobile_image_alt_desc":"\"Fit, slim woman with low body fat ratio running with hills in the background\"", "c_header_mobile_image_path":"img/blog-img/default", "c_header_mobile_image_width":"520", "c_header_mobile_image_height":"409", "c_created_on":"2017-12-06 07:01:23", "c_summary":"Are you looking forward to lose weight?

These medicines and therapies propound the use of natural herbs, medicinal plants, their parts and extracts, fruits, vegetables and even flowers! One such popular idea is the use of garlic to treat vaginal infections.

Garlic happens to be nature\u2019s antibiotic and fungicide. <br>Garlic contains a chemical known as allicin, known for its sharpness and pungency.</p><p><br></p><p>Although garlic is not as potent as the commonly available allopathic antibiotics, it can still be used to treat bacteria and yeast infections to some extent, especially the ones that have developed resistance to modern antibiotics.</p><p><br></p><ol><li>According to Charaka Sutra (Vedic physician Charaka\u2019s treatise), Garlic is \u2018Mehahara\u2019 \u2013 useful in urinary tract disorders.</li><li>For maximum effectiveness, the treatment of vaginal infections using garlic needs to start at the onset of the infection. Take a clove of garlic, peel off the white outer covering and insert it into the vagina during bedtime. Care needs to be taken that the garlic remains intact (Any piercing or puncture will cause the release of allicin and cause burning inside). Garlic usually causes watery discharge. In the morning, the garlic can either be manually removed or be flushed out of the system via urine. Usually, one night\u2019s treatment does the trick, but if the infection continues, the procedure can be done for two to three nights.</li></ol><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a title=\"Garlic as Medicinal Herb: Used in Ayurveda for Thousands of Years\" href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-is-ayurvedic-medicinal-herb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-is-ayurvedic-medicinal-herb\">Garlic as Medicinal Herb: Used in Ayurveda for Thousands of Years</a></strong></p><p><br></p><p><br>If the garlic treatment did not start at the onset of the infection and the infection advances, it could still be treated with garlic. Clean the discharge using a dry tissue. This time, peel and cut a garlic clove in half, sew a thread through it (for easy retrieval) and insert in the vagina during bed-time for overnight effectiveness. In the morning, use the thread for retrieving the cut garlic. This process needs to be repeated for a few nights. However, if this still doesn\u2019t work, then over-the-counter stronger antibiotic creams will need to be used.</p><p><br>Cut garlic makes the activity of the garlic stronger. When sliced garlic is inserted in a healthy vagina, it causes \u2018burning\u2019 and \u2018redness.\u2019 However, when cut garlic is inserted into an infected vagina, it cures the yeast infection and also repairs the soreness and redness of the skin.</p><p><br>The reason this procedure is recommended at night during bedtime is that there is a link between the vagina and the mouth. When garlic is inserted into a vagina, the woman can taste the garlic in her mouth almost instantly. Since most people find the taste of garlic offensive, the garlic treatment is preferred as a bedtime treatment.</p><p><br>In important research done in China, garlic has been shown to kill bacteria culture grown in labs successfully. Researchers also found that garlic lost its anti-bacterial properties within 20 minutes of being boiled at 100 degrees Celsius. Therefore, for best antibiotic results, garlic needs to be used raw. Studies in Iran showed that when a cream containing garlic and thyme that was used to treat fungal infections of the vagina was compared to a clotrimazole-based antifungal cream (standard creams used for treating fungal infections), it was as effective as the clotrimazole cream.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a title=\"Garlic is a Natural Antibiotic: Traditionally Garlic has been used Around the World as an Antibiotic\" href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-as-antibiotic-traditional-use\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-as-antibiotic-traditional-use\">Garlic is a Natural Antibiotic: Traditionally Garlic has been used Around the World as an Antibiotic</a></strong></p><p><br></p><p><br>A word of warning \u2013 Insertion of a foreign substance in the vagina may not suit every woman.

A study was undertaken in 2015 by a team of researchers from the University of Stirling, Scotland and Charles University, the Czech Republic, headed by Ethologist Jitka Fialov\u00e1 of Charles University. In this study, during Experiment No. 1, 42 men were asked to eat one or two garlic cloves, 500-milligram garlic capsules or no garlic. The volunteers were made to wear sweatpads in their armpits for 12 hours afterward to collect body odor. These men were then asked to stay off garlic and go on a cheese sandwich diet. Again, sweat pads from armpits were collected. 82 women were asked to sniff the sweat pads and rank them according to their pleasantness, attractiveness, masculinity, and intensity. During this experiment, not much difference was found in the intensity of the body odors in the different sweat pads due to different diets.

The same men volunteers were made to consume at least four cloves or one 1,000-milligram garlic-extract capsule. The above process of collecting sweat in pads in armpits was repeated. This time, the body odor of those men who had consumed garlic in some form or manner were judged to be less masculine and more attractive than those who hadn\u2019t consumed garlic at all. When the body odor was judged as less intense and more pleasant, there was also a lowering of the masculine rating of the odor.</p><p><br></p><p>As per the research journal Appetite, in the sexual evolution of man and other animals, body odor played a significant role when females selected mates and when humans formed intimate relationships. In many animals, including humans, diets and food choices determine body odor.</p><p><br></p><p>We know that garlic has <a title=\"Garlic is a Natural Antibiotic\" href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-natural-antibiotic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-natural-antibiotic\">antibacterial, anti-fungal</a>, <a title=\"Antioxidant Activity of Garlic: It is a Natural Antioxidant\" href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-a-natural-antioxidant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-a-natural-antioxidant\">anti-oxidant</a>, <a title=\"Garlic and Cardiovascular Disease: Prevent and Cure Heart Related Ailments with Garlic\" href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-good-for-cardiovascular-disease\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-good-for-cardiovascular-disease\">cardiovascular</a>, anti-cancer and other immunity stimulants.

Quoting Dr. Fialov\u00e1, \u201cWomen may also use cues in body odor to find a partner who can secure quality food.\u201d In this study, women may have subconsciously perceived the reduction in the intensity of the body odor as a subtle sign of good health.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a title=\"Garlic Helps to Treat Vaginal Infections Caused by Microorganisms or Sexual Intercourse\" href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-vaginal-infections\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-vaginal-infections\">Garlic Helps to Treat Vaginal Infections Caused by Microorganisms or Sexual Intercourse</a></strong></p><p><br></p><p>If we look closer home, as per Ayurveda, common reasons for body odor is improper digestion and skin problems.

However, research in China shows that garlic loses its anti-bacterial properties when boiled in boiling water (100 degree Celsius) for 20 minutes. Therefore, garlic needs to be consumed raw and in reasonable amounts to achieve the above benefits. <strong>Read More:&nbsp;<a title=\"Garlic as Medicinal Herb: Used in Ayurveda for Thousands of Years\" href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-is-ayurvedic-medicinal-herb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/garlic-is-ayurvedic-medicinal-herb\">Garlic as Medicinal Herb: Used in Ayurveda for Thousands of Years</a></strong></p><p><br></p><p>So, this study does throw light to an interesting observation.

There are two ways in which people become \"fat\" or have an increase in weight. One is the excessive growth of the size of the fat cells. The other is an excess of multiplication of fat cells, i.e., the number of cells that occur. If any of these processes can slow down, weight loss would be possible.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Turmeric contains curcumin, which inhibits cell division in adipocytes (fat cells) by reducing the amount of blood that flows in these cells. Due to the lack of incoming fresh blood nutrients, the fat cells do not increase in number.<br></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Also Read:&nbsp;<a title=\"Turmeric is a Natural Beauty Booster, having Amazing Benefits for Skin\" href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/turmeric-natural-beauty-booster\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.wellnez.in/turmeric-natural-beauty-booster\">Turmeric is a Natural Beauty Booster, having Amazing Benefits for Skin</a></strong></p><p><br></p><h2>The Diet of Turmeric to Lose Weight</h2><p>As with all fashions, when there is any indication of a substance that shows promise in weight loss solutions, different diets and regimens arise incorporating turmeric.

Let\u2019s check out some other benefits of turmeric!</p><p><br><br></p><h3>Turmeric A \"Miraculous\" Spice</h3><p>Turmeric is used in the kitchens of the Indian subcontinent and several other parts of the world for its earthy flavor and bright color. It has several health benefits, and weight loss is one of them. It has the following health benefits:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>It is anti-inflammatory by nature. As a result, it helps those who have painful joints and related conditions such as arthritis. Also, unlike anti-inflammatory drugs, turmeric has no side effects.</li><li>It has antiseptic and antimicrobial properties. Therefore, if you have an injury, turmeric can accelerate the healing process.</li><li>Recent research shows that turmeric possesses several chemicals that can be attributed to the protection against Alzheimer's disease.</li><li>Turmeric gives your immune system a healthy stimulus. It even protects and fights against certain types of cancer such as breast cancer and melanoma.</li><li>It has been used as an antidepressant in China for centuries.</li><li>It also helps in the elimination of accumulated toxins in the liver.</li></ul><p><br><br></p><h3>Turmeric Reduces Cholesterol</h3><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/turmeric/default/turmeric-weight-loss/cholesterol-written-on-creative-on-white-background.jpg' width='700' height='505' alt='Turmeric reduces cholesterol.

It is unofficially known as \u201cKing of Ayurveda\u201d and has been used in Indian subcontinent for centuries. Here are some amazing benefits of this herb on Nervous System:</p><ul><li>Used for anti-anxiety treatment. (<a title=\"R\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270108/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4270108/\">R</a>)</li><li>It is an antidepressant and analgesic.</li><li>Western Clinical Research proves that it is an Adaptogen (a substance that restores the brain or body to homeostasis after physical or psychological stress). (<a title=\"R\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-mce-href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3573577/\">R</a>)</li><li>Ashwagandha works to calm down the brain in a similar way as the benzodiazepine drug lorazepam (Antivan). It also enhances the activity of GABA (gamma amino butyric acid).</li><li>It modulates the serotonin receptors in a positive way.</li><li>It positively impacts the brain\u2019s dopamine system.</li><li>Ashwagandha has an anti-fatigue and anti-stress effect on human body.</li></ul><p>There is no doubt that Ashwagandha is a real potent regenerative tonic (Rasayana of Ayurveda).

If you think of your brain as a highway network of neurons and synapses, Brahmi works to keep the traffic flowing smoothly.</li></ul><p><br><strong>Side-Effects</strong></p><p>Like many other ayurvedic herbs, Ashwagandha and Brahmi are relatively safe. They are free from troubling side-effects and toxicity, and have been used in ayurveda for over centuries.</p><p><br></p><p>However pregnant woman should consult a physician before taking these herbs, as the effects on the unborn fetus are as yet unknown.</p><p><br></p><h2>Claming Herbal Teas</h2><p><amp-img src='http://www.wellnez.in/wellnez/img/blog-img/home-remedies/default/anxiety-stress-insomnia-ayurvedic-home-remedies/woman-drinking-herbal-tea.jpg' width='700' height='1050' alt='Smiling woman drinking a herbal tea.' layout='responsive'></amp-img></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3>Tagar and Musta Tea</h3><p>Prepare a tea with following herbs:</p><p>Tarar or Valerian - 1 part<br></p><p>Musta - 1 part</p><p>\u201cSteep \u00bd teaspoon of these herbs in 1 cup hot water for 5 to 10 minutes, and drink.
