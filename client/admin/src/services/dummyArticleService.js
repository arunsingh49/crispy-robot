			'<p><br></p><p>The body recomposition is a goal of twin processes – ‘burning body fat and building muscle’ simultaneously. Both processes are delicate subjects in the world of building better physique. Body recomposition can be really difficult, if not done properly. It is essential to know that while losing body fat, our body also loses muscle weight.</p><p><br></p><p>However, the right approach and understanding the basics of body recomposition actually helps in building muscles while reducing body fat.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to burn fat while building muscles require hard work and determination. You need to keep your focus on three keys: Diet, Cardiovascular exercises and Weight training. These three elements are the keys to body recomposition.</p><p><br></p><p>They help you maintain a healthy balance between over- training and under- nourishing. In any way, body recomposition should be done under proper guidance and instructions to avoid muscle mass to drop off. Diet, cardio and weight training are designed according to the fundamental of matching energy demand with energy intake.</p><p><br></p><p>Diet is undoubtedly an important aspect of your overall fitness. Nutrition contributes atleast 75% to your body recomposition followed by exercise and weight training. So you need to get your diet and workout routine in order. &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Follow these extremely effective ways to build your body as you want:</p><p><br></p><h2>Diet</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/diet.jpg" alt="Healthy food items placed on a table." width="700" height="467" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/diet.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>In order to gain energy, you first need to give up on gimmicky weight loss plans and fake supplements. Use an all natural diet to become healthy and active. Eating moderate portions of whole and unprocessed food can contribute well to your heart and muscles. Consume only those food items which help you fuel up your daily functions. This way you feel fatigueless and more energetic throughout the day.</p><p><br></p><h2>1. Intake of proteins</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/1-intake-of-proteins.jpg" alt="Man preparing a protein rich diet (eggs, sausages, etc.) in a frying pan." width="700" height="937" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/1-intake-of-proteins.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Proteins are vital for building lean muscle mass. Having protein in your diet after workout help your body in rebuilding muscles. Building muscle mass through diet boosts your metabolism. It also turns body fat to lean mass, thus, makes your over all body composition healthier than before.</p><p><br></p><p>Proteins prove to be very helpful in losing fat. They contribute in making your tummy feel full. So, you tend to crave less for more food. Consuming adequate protein burns body fat as it demands more calories to digest it. Thus, it helps in losing fat faster while maintain muscle mass.</p><p><br></p><p>Appropriate non vegetarian high protein food: Chicken, lean mutton, salmon fish, tuna fish and eggs.</p><p><br></p><p>Vegetarian high protein food: Broccoli, mustard greens, soybeans, leafy greens and peanut butter.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>2. Eat less Carbohydrates</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/2-eat-less-carbohydrates.jpg" alt="A single banana showing less carbohydrates." width="700" height="700" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/2-eat-less-carbohydrates.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Cutting carbohydrates from your regular diet is one of the best ways to lose weight. Consuming less carbohydrate tends to reduce your appetite. Thus, you keep losing weight automatically. Moreover, carbohydrates help your body absorb proteins which does not let it turn into fat and gain weight.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>It is recommended that carbohydrates should be consumed before workout as they give instant energy to burn calories. This way, carbohydrates contribute a lot to workout routine and diet, if consumed properly.</p><p><br></p><p>Appropriate carbohydrates for body building: Whole grain bread, pasta and rice. These food items also reduce high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes. Oatmeal and sweet potatoes are also considered as the best source of carbohydrates.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>3. Count your calories</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/3-count-your-calories.jpg" alt="Women counting calories on her phone while all the food items are placed in front of her on a table." width="700" height="578" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/3-count-your-calories.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Your calorie intake plays a very important role in body building. You cannot fill your stomach with unhealthy food or large meals 1-2 times in a day. This will lead to other abnormal weight problems. Balancing your calories is important as too many calories may lead to weight gain and too few calories can result in no muscle mass. It is always recommended to eat more calories than your body burns off during workout and all day long.</p><p><br></p><p>Eat high quality protein, nutritious meals and natural food atleast 6 times a day. Use fresh vegetables, fruits and whole grains in place of processed food made with refine sugar and grains. High fiber food promotes fat loss and keeps your tummy full for long time. Focus on high quality protein as it helps in repair and growth of muscles.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>4. No to ‘Processed Food’</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/4-no-to-processed-food.jpg" alt="Vector image of a can of processed food." width="700" height="562" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/4-no-to-processed-food.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>It is rightly being said, <em>“The key to healthy eating is avoid any food that has a TV Commercial.”</em></p><p><br></p><p>Processed food is the enemy of a healthy body. They are high in preservatives and flavours with almost zero nutrition value. The unhealthiest facts of processed food are the artificial sweeteners and synthetic vitamins that gradually make the body go weak.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Immediately stop consuming food products like packed chips and cookies, frozen or instant made food, artificial drinks or juices and packed chicken or meat.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Cardiovascular Exercises</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/cardiovascular-exercises.jpg" alt="People in gym doing aerobics and other cardiovascular exercises." width="700" height="393" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/cardiovascular-exercises.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The ultimate goal to build a fit body is to lose fat while maintaining good amount of muscle you have. Cardiovascular exercises mainly demand more calories which increases fat loss. While doing cardio training, a lot of people lose muscle mass with fat. This is only for the reason they lose calories more than their body intake. So it is important to set out a strict routine to balance your cardio and weight training.</p><p>To carve a great physique, it is important to properly pair your cardio training with weight training. For example, do low intensity cardio for 30 minutes preceded by 45-60 minutes weight training. This result in fat loss and at the same time adds lean mass to your muscles.</p><p>Do not pre-assume that you need to hit a gym for intense cardio. Choosing natural ways to do cardio is the most appropriate approach of body building. Here are a few cardio exercises that can be done outside the gym:</p><p><br></p><h2>1.Running</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/1running.jpg" alt="People running while sun shines in the background." width="700" height="700" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/1running.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>It is one of the best ways to get your cardiovascular training in place. Do not hop on to the treadmill directly for running. Prefer to run outdoors which supplies oxygen to your heart and overall body. If you lead an unhealthy lifestyle due to work, then running outdoors works best to burst stress.</p><p><br></p><p>Running proves to be a great natural fat burning tool. The more you run, the more your body speeds up the fat loss process.</p><p><br></p><p>If you’re a beginner, running for 20 minutes is good to start with. But if you have reached at a higher level of workout then it has to be 30 to 45 minutes.</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Stairmaster</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/2-stairmaster.jpg" alt="Athletic, young man running up the stairs." width="700" height="599" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/2-stairmaster.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>The Stairmaster works best when you have to sweat your body and release toxins from it. Make it your first choice if you want to target glutes and thighs. Stairmaster guarantees to make you lose fat faster. It is a great workout to bring your buttocks in shape. The Stairmaster results are always amazing when done regularly.</p><p><br></p><p>For beginners, it is recommended to climb stairs for 15 minutes starting from walking to running.&nbsp; After reaching a high level workout, you can increase the time from 15 minutes to 30 minutes two – three times a week.</p><p><br></p><h2>3. Jumping Rope</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/3-jumping-rope.jpg" alt="Vector image of a girl jumping on a skipping rope." width="700" height="700" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/3-jumping-rope.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>For high intensity workout, add rope jumping in your routine. It is a perfect way to boost metabolism and burn fat quickly. Adding variations in speed of jumping rope really helps in sweating your body badly. When you become regular with rope jump, you will gradually start observing the fat melting off your body.</p><p><br></p><p>Jumping rope proves to be one of the most effective cardio workouts. It has a low impact on knee when executed properly. Maintain an upright posture and balance by looking straight ahead. Focus on your speed to burn fat. For best performance, shorten the rope as it improves the rope’s rational speed and reflexes.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Weight Training</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/weight-training.jpg" alt="People lifting weights and doing weight training in a gym." width="700" height="467" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/burn-fat-build-muscle/weight-training.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Weight training is one of the most difficult elements of the body recomposition. It involves great training ambitions and nutrition strategy together. Make weight training a regular part of your workout. It not only builds muscles but also tones your body in proper shape.</p><p>For building muscles, you need to improve your strength and define your body. You can divide your muscle building and weight training program in to three phases. These are – Building base, Hypertrophy and Tone your body.</p><h2><br></h2><h2>1.Building Base</h2><p><br></p><p>Building Base is just like building the foundation of your resistance training program. In this phase, you work for building strength, endurance and stability of joints. The most effective part of this phase is circuit training. It uses high intensity aerobics as well as muscular training. Make a circuit of exercises and on the completion of that circuit; begin again with the same circuit. Exercises included in a circuit should work on each body part individually. &nbsp;Try to lift moderate weights in this phase.</p><p><br></p><p>For upper body, include exercises like squat ups, bench dips, Back extensions, etc.</p><p><br></p><p>For lower body, the most effective exercises are squat jumps, compass jumps, step ups, bench squats and hopping shuttles.</p><p><br></p><p>For core &amp; trunk, exercises like Sit ups, stomach crunch and back extension chest raise are the best.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Hypertrophy</h2><p><br></p><p>Once you have built the foundation of your training program, it is time to challenge the muscles to grow. Hypertrophy induces the fastest muscle growth. This is the phase where people actually transform their body and improve their physique. Hypertrophy also results in producing more hormones which loses body fat and fosters muscle growth.</p><p><br></p><p>For better results, use challenging weights that make every last repetition difficult.</p><p><br></p><h2>3. Tone your Body</h2><p><br></p><p>After building a strong foundation and adding muscle mass, there comes the time to tone your body. Toning your body means firming up each part of the body. In this phase, lift heavier weights that challenge the final repetition. Design this phase in a vertical format by adding exercise one after the other. Complete all sets of exercises, take rest for 60-120 seconds and then start again from the top.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>Follow natural diet; make your cardio a routine and weight training a part of your lifestyle. Get an amazing body to live a healthy life.</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>',

This practice is very helpful in avoiding over-eating and helps in better digestion of food.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from the health benefits, mindful eating will help your taste buds to sense your food to the fullest.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>A light dinner</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/a-light-dinner.jpg" alt="A light dinner placed in a bowl mostly comprising of salads." width="700" height="524" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/a-light-dinner.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Avoid eating late at night. At least have a gap of about 2-3 hours between your last meal and sleep time.</p><p><br></p><p>Because of less body movement, the digestion process tends to slow down and as a result all the undigested food starts getting accumulated as fats.</p><p><br></p><h2>Keeping a check on calories</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/keeping-a-check-on-calories.jpg" alt="Woman counting calories on her mobile while food items are placed in front of her on a table." width="700" height="529" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/keeping-a-check-on-calories.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Rather than consuming coffee or snacks in-between your meals, replace that with fruits and detox drinks like green tea.</p><p><br></p><p>It will be really helpful to cut down your daily calories.</p><p><br></p><h2>Drink water before eating</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Quite often we confuse our thirst with hunger and thus end up eating a snack when in reality the body is demanding water.</p><p><br></p><p>The reason is hypothalamus, it is the area in the brain that controls hunger and thirst and it sends the same signals for both. So when you are hungry first drink a glass of water and then eat. Chances are that your hunger will subdue.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2 style="text-align: center;" data-mce-style="text-align: center;">Adopting better lifestyle habits</h2><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Drink Water</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/drink-water.jpg" alt="Woman drinking water while sitting on a couch." width="700" height="404" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/drink-water.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Drink plenty of water throughout the day. It helps to flush out toxins from your body. Studies have shown that taking 2-3 glasses of lukewarm water immediately after waking up on an empty stomach helps to boost your body metabolism and remove toxins from your body more effectively.</p><p><br></p><p>It is recommended to take a full glass of water just before your meal so as to decrease the overall hunger. Also: taking a glass of water after 30 minutes of having your meal aids in digestion. On an average drinking 8 to 10 glasses of water in a day are considered optimal.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Exercise</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/exercise.jpg" alt="Man exercising in his home." width="700" height="458" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/exercise.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Nothing can replace the benefits of exercising. Simply running not only helps you in burning calories but it also keeps your body in good shape and reduces stress. In general running or jogging for 30 minutes twice or thrice a week is good enough to keep your body slim and fit.</p><p><br></p><p>Apart from running, including a few strength training exercises in your routine can prove to be extremely healthy for your body.</p><p><br></p><p>For instance, Push-ups and squats have proven to be one of the most effective exercises to burn calories. Exercising regularly will keep your body fit and in good shape throughout your lifetime.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h2>Get enough sleep</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/get-enough-sleep.jpg" alt="Woman sleeping comfortably and peacefully. " width="700" height="700" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/get-enough-sleep.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Getting a sound and regular sleep plays an important role in maintaining healthy weight. The only time when your body rests, recovers and repairs itself is while you are sleeping. Studies have shown that people who do not sleep for adequate hours tend to be obese and unfit.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, same studies have confirmed that when you do not get adequate sleep then the level of ‘Ghrelin’ in your body rises. Ghrelin is the hunger hormone that your brain releases which asks you to eat more and as a result leading to obesity. A person should sleep atleast 8 hours in a day.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Walking</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/walking.jpg" alt="A couple walking in a park." width="700" height="410" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/be-slim-n-fit/walking.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is indeed the lack of physical activities which is one of the most prominent reasons of weight gain and unfit body. People can make excuse of their busy lifestyle in order to neglect regular exercise.</p><p><br></p><p>But when it comes to walking, it can be done anywhere and fits into daily routine easily. Simple yet effective ways to increase your physical activities can be like taking stairs instead of elevator and walking down to the nearby markets rather than taking your car.</p><p><br></p><p>Studies have shown that even taking a 10 minute walk post your meal can help you burn quick calories and aids digestion.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>',

			'<p>A good run can do amazing things for you. So whether you are an athlete or not these running exercises can help you boost your stamina as well as increase speed. But before you start your workout, keep in mind to start it with a warmup.</p><p><br></p><p>Warming up before working out reduces the risk of injury, increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases heart rate which in turn helps you in burning more calories. <br>A good warmup can be something like; a 6-8 minutes of jogging, mild/light exercises and stretching. This piece of writing focuses mainly on the running workouts or exercises that help you to increase your speed and stamina. So let’s dive deep in and get our kicks running. <br></p><h2><br>1) Run Long</h2><p><img alt="Man running a long distance run along a long road-bridge with mountains in the background." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/1-run-long.jpg" width="700" height="465" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/1-run-long.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Its simple – To run more, you actually have to “run further”. The best way to increase you running distance is by increasing the running time by 5 minutes every day or by increasing running distance everyday (approx 0.5 miles daily). It might sound a little but it really adds up in the end.</p><p><br></p><p>The good idea is to run at a slow pace and be consistent in completing the track rather than running fast and then struggling to finish. Once you get hold of it then increase your speed. There’s a great saying that – “Speed follows Endurance”. So completing your run till the last mile decided and this is surely going to increase your speed as well as stamina.</p><p><br></p><h2>2) Tempo Runs</h2><p><img alt="Young woman running in sports outfit, seems to be in a tempo run to increase speed and endurance." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/2-tempo-runs.jpg" width="700" height="1054" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/2-tempo-runs.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Tempo runs basically range for a shorter distance but at a pace higher than the normal at which you would generally run. Release of Lactic acid in your body is the reason behind the fatigue that you feel. Tempo runs like these trains your body in cleaning out lactic acid from your bloodstream quicker. This means that you can run at longer intervals and the lactic acid and fatigue building up in your body at a slower rate. It also makes you feel easier at running pace. Tempo runs are the key to improve the running speed.</p><p><br></p><p>For mid range and novice runners, tempo runs should last for about 20-30 minutes and approximately an hour for high end or advanced runners. Tempo runs should be done at a pace that you can maintain over the whole running duration rather than an all-in-one effort at a time leading to panting and slowing down. <br></p><p><br></p><h2>3) Interval Training</h2><p><img alt="Young man running on pavement." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/3-interval-training.jpg" width="700" height="467" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/3-interval-training.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Interval trainings are a great way to increase your stamina, speed and endurance. Interval trainings basically involve alternating you running styles and speed. An example would be – Sprint as fast as possible for an interval of 30 seconds and then slowing down to a speed approximately 70% of your sprint and then continuing at that speed for another 2-3 minutes and after that again start sprinting.</p><p><br></p><p>Another example would be – running on an inclined path. This allows the body to recover in between the sprinting and slow running sessions. You can repeat these intervals approx 4-5 times keeping walking/jogging resting sessions in between.</p><p><br></p><h2>4) Run with the beat</h2><p><img alt="Slightly older woman running while listening to music and holding an mp3 player in her hand." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/4-run-with-the-beat.jpg" width="700" height="933" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/4-run-with-the-beat.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Voila, this trick is quite effective when it comes to working out. Keep your headphones on while running. It is a human tendency that we match our footsteps with the beats of the music. Keep up with the tempo of the music. As the music goes slow, your speed goes slow and as the music beats pump, your speed increases too. Music helps in maintaining the flow and keep you running.</p><p><br></p><p>So just make your running playlist with whatever kind of music you prefer and get your kicks running. Music also fills you up with energy and keeps you boosted. Running with the music beats pumping is an implicit way of interval running. In a study conducted, people with the music turned on while running ran an extra mile as compared to people without the music beats on.</p><p><br></p><h2>5) Running Stairs</h2><p><img alt="Athletic, young man running up the stairs to increase performance, strength, speed  and stamina." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/5-running-stairs.jpg" width="700" height="700" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/5-running-stairs.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Well, it turns out that whenever you are running up the stairs you are indirectly doing a lot of plyometrics. Running up the stairs exerts maximum force to your body muscles. It’s like doing cardio exercises along with lunges and squats. The best thing about this exercise is that; you train your hamstrings in a way that they are not generally used to.</p><p><br></p><p>Another benefit is that it increases your overall leg strength. It takes a lot of explosive power to speed up the stairs and you reach your AT (anaerobic threshold) quickly. Your body reaches to a point where it creates more lactic acid as compared to the quantity it can process. Training your body beyond anaerobic threshold improves your stamina and strength in an immense way than any other running exercise. <br></p><h2><br></h2><h2>6) Walking Lunges</h2><p><img alt="Young woman doing lunges while walking." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/6-walking-lunges.jpg" width="700" height="1050" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/6-walking-lunges.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Walking lunges directly impact the thigh and leg muscles. They are great at improving the balance of the body posture. They also tone the hip muscles. Apart from all these, walking lunges improve the hip flexibility and make your thighs stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>Stronger thighs directly impact the leg muscles strength. So indulging your body in exercising walking lunges before or after running will have a direct impact on speed and endurance as it will make your leg muscles stronger.</p><p><br></p><h2>7) Progressive Running workout</h2><p><img alt="Creative of a man running fast with a progressive pace." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/7-progressive-running-workout.jpg" width="700" height="495" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/7-progressive-running-workout.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>It’s simple: Start slow – Constantly increase your pace – Finish fast.<br>Just start your run at a normal slow pace but keep increasing it as you go further and aim to finish at a sprinting pace. Progressive runs like these indulge your body in a complete workout as they use both your anaerobic and aerobic systems. It also gives your body a recovery time as a normal running workout.</p><p><br></p><p>An example of progressive running workout would be – to run at an easy normal pace for approx 15 minutes followed by a hard pace comfortable run for another 15 minutes and then the next 15 minutes at an uncomfortable hard pace. The basic idea is to increment the running speed at every 15 minutes interval. <br></p><h2><br></h2><h2>8) The fartlek running</h2><p><img alt="Sporty and determined woman running with varying speeds in a park, while dressed in sports outfit." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/8-the-fartlek-running.jpg" width="700" height="467" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/8-the-fartlek-running.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>The Swedish meaning of fartlek is “speed-play” and that’s the whole flavour of this workout – to play around with different distances and speed in one workout. The process of this workout is simple like intermixing slow and fast running and varying the distance and pace at each interval.</p><p><br></p><p>There are no rules to this workout and it can be as flexible as you want. Just randomly pick any place like a park or a street and then start sprinting for 2 minutes then slow pace running for 4 minutes or vice versa. Fartlek runs are very unstructured and unorganised. <br></p><p><br></p><p>These were all the running workouts that increase the speed and stamina of your running. There is more to building endurance like eating the proper food and indulging in workouts. To keep you on a good track there are some workouts and exercises that do wonders when it comes to building endurance and stamina. Some of them are:</p><h3><br>* Plyometrics</h3><p><img alt="Woman jumping high with a skipping rope, like in a froggy jump." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/plyometrics.jpg" width="700" height="1054" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/plyometrics.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Plyometrics are basically the explosive workouts like jumping squats, jumping lunges, burpees and froggy jumps. Explosive cardiovascular workouts like these are the core to building a strong foundation to a muscular body. Workouts like these burn a lot of calories too. <br></p><p><br></p><h3>* Strength Training</h3><p><img alt="Fit and healthy man doing weight training in a gym to increase strength, speed and stamina." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/strength-training.jpg" width="700" height="1054" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/strength-training.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Of course you need strong legs to run a long distance. So, strength training is very vital to building endurance and stamina too. The core strength of the leg muscles really matters when it comes to running longer and better. Strong muscular legs increase power and it consequently leads to increased stamina and speed. <br></p><h3><br></h3><h3>* Proper Nutrition</h3><p><img alt="Nutritious Food served in a plate: Colorful vegetables and chicken, rich in lean proteins, minerals, vitamins and carbohydrates; Required for building speed and stamina." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/proper-nutrition.jpg" width="700" height="628" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/proper-nutrition.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Taking a good diet is of utmost importance to building stamina and endurance. The food that you feed your body acts as the fuel to everything that follows be it a simple run or an aggressive workout. Make sure to take in good carbs and lean proteins.<br></p><h3><br></h3><h3>* Stretching</h3><p><img alt="Young and smiling woman stretching and warming up before a run, dressed in sports outfit." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/stretching.jpg" width="700" height="1050" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-exercises-improve-speed-stamina/stretching.jpg"></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p><p>Make it a golden rule of thumb: Never go running without doing a good warmup and cool down always after you have completed your workout. Stretching before starting your work out loosens up your muscles and increases the performance.<br>Happy running.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>',

It is beneficial in boosting overall health of your brain.</p><p><br></p><h2>3. Running cuts off stress</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/6-ways-running-rejuvenates-mind/3-running-cuts-off-stress.jpg" alt="Man running and feeling jubilant, energetic, and high-spirited with hands raised in the air." width="700" height="406" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/6-ways-running-rejuvenates-mind/3-running-cuts-off-stress.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Stress comes with a lot of reasons. These reasons may mainly be the inappropriate work schedule or lifestyle. You may notice many symptoms of stress like severe pain in neck, back, shoulder and head. When you are under stress, you also go through insomnia, diarrhoea, stomach ache and many other problems.</p><p><br></p><p>All these symptoms can easily turn into harmful effects of stress when not treated with any outdoor physical activity.

Running provides mental energy</h2><p><img class="blog-img" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/6-ways-running-rejuvenates-mind/4-running-provides-mental-energy.jpg" alt="Woman feeling refreshed and lively while her hands are raised in the air towards the sky." width="700" height="287" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/6-ways-running-rejuvenates-mind/4-running-provides-mental-energy.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Running is a form of relaxation in its own way. In this fast moving life, you utilize your mind 24 x 7 for performing day to day functions better. But you never think of providing energy to your mind which commands your body to act. People in today’s time, don’t leave their mind free from thinking even for a minute.</p><p><br></p><p>This leads to over thinking which in turn exhausts their mind badly.

			'<p>How many times have you gone out for a running session and felt like your feet were made of concrete, or even worse? Astonishingly, they might not feel so bad from something that you did as from something that you didn’t do. Treat your legs well in between runs to gain more enjoyment and fulfilment from your workout session, boost your performance, and speed up recovery time. &nbsp;So whether you are a pro or beginner, here are is everything you need to know about running. Let’s get started.</p><p><br></p><h2>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Don’t miss out running even for a day</h2><p><img alt="Man in top of a turned down vehicle, try his best to get what he wants" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/1-dont-miss-out-running-even-for-a-day.jpg" width="700" height="467" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/1-dont-miss-out-running-even-for-a-day.jpg"></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It’s a very well known and a famous quote – “Persistence is the key to success”. Imagine it this way; 30 minutes of running a day for 30 days equals 900 minutes of total running a month, and 900 minutes of running not only sounds behemoth but also has amazing effects on the body. &nbsp;A regular and continuous running schedule helps to improve your body’s ability to burn more calories along with your biomechanics. It also trains your mind to endure through any kind of challenge, be of any kind physical or mental. If you stay persistent at following your running schedule then you will surely notice the difference in no time.</p><p><br></p><h2>2. Invest in comfort</h2><p><img alt="Smiling, sporty woman feeling comfortable in her sports outfit" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/2-invest-in-comfort.jpg" width="700" height="1087" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/2-invest-in-comfort.jpg"></p><p>“No pain, no gain” sounds only good to hear. In reality, studies have shown that the more comfortable you feel, much easier it’ll be for you to last long during your workout. Buy a good fit running outfit, body glide balm and sport socks. Nothing can kill a run like a blister about to pop. Track the miles on your shoes. At about 250 miles, mid-soles can become too compressed to get back to their original form between runs, and your feet and ankles will begin to notice. That’s why be sure to replace your shoes at regular intervals.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>3. Give yourself a solid reason</h2><p><img alt="Creative: silhouette of a running woman with reason and message as: Winners never quit and quitters never win" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/3-give-yourself-a-solid-reason.jpg" width="700" height="700" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/3-give-yourself-a-solid-reason.jpg"></p><p><br></p><p>For whatever action we do, when we have a strong motivation inside us then it becomes incredibly easily to implement the action. For instance, I started as a team in training charity marathons, having lost my loved one to breast cancer. When I am struggling with my training schedules, I recollect in my mind those people who are still fighting their battles, those who have survived in the part because of the money raised and those people who have been taken away from us. Things like these boost my adrenaline and keep me pumped up and motivated.</p><p><br></p><h2>4. Collaboration is the secret to great running</h2><p><br></p><p>Of course we learn a lot from people around us and we are actually the sum of 5 people we spend most of our time with. Hang around those who are serious about running, and in that way you will be able to pick up a few titbits – how to set pace for yourself, which routes have the most hygienic restrooms, what cloth to wear when the weather is changing more rapidly than a facebook feed. We asked trainers, nutritionists, coaches and veteran athletes to share their strategies. Just steal them to be able to run longer, feel lighter and stay accident-free.</p><p><br></p><h2>5. Stay positive</h2><p><img alt="Smiling woman with positive attitude while showing thumps up" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/5-stay-positive.jpg" width="700" height="467" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/5-stay-positive.jpg"></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>From the words of Buddha – “What you think is what you become”. The mantra of being able to have a positive attitude works in all kind of situations in life and running being no exception. Finish runs feeling strong and joyful, not worn-out. It will keep you coming back again for more and help you reduce injuries in sports.</p><p><br></p><h2>6. Find the sweet spot for you</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is really helpful to write down your workouts throughout the week, and then you can colour-code them in a way they make you feel. For example, Yellow for ‘amazing’, orange for ‘Just OK’ and red may be ‘Really bad workout’. It is a nice visual way of seeing how your body reacts and it will immensely help you to pick up the most suitable words for you. Like, if you are always orange or may be red around your streak, then it is a sign that you should be doing lighter workouts on such days.</p><p><br></p><h2>7. Layer less</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is always an advisable practice to dress to run like it is 10 to 15 degrees warmer than it is. As soon you go out in the open and get to moving, your body will get all warmed and heated up well and you will be glad that you did not put so many layers.</p><p><br></p><h2>8. Stay away from parties, alcohol specifically</h2><p><img alt="Glasses hanging from a stand in a bar with bright party lights in the background." src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/8-stay-away-from-parties-alcohol-specifically.jpg" width="700" height="467" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/8-stay-away-from-parties-alcohol-specifically.jpg"></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Please don’t let your long lasting hard work get destroyed by snacks and beer at late night parties. Steer clear of happy hour the day or two before your running or training session. The munchies that you eat while having alcohol especially beer are the ‘weight-increasers’. Alcohol is known to significantly affect sleep quality and hydration levels, as well the post recovery of the body. With alcohol everything goes down the drain, so stay away from alcohol. If you have to indulge in consuming alcohol then make sure to consume it in moderate amounts.</p><h2>9. Be smart in training</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In order to get yourself stronger, your body needs proper time to rebuild. Try to mix easy days with tough ones, and also avoid pushing when the body signals for a break. It’s not at all good practice to keep straining your body beyond your limits. The better way to train your body is by ‘gradual training’ and not ‘all at once’. In that way you will see a drastic improvement over the course of time and it also reduces the risk of injury.</p><p><br></p><h2>10. Down a cup of coffee</h2><p><img alt="Woman drinking coffee while holding the cup in hand" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/10-down-a-cup-of-coffee.jpg" width="700" height="878" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/10-down-a-cup-of-coffee.jpg"></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Here is the good news - having caffeine before the workout has been linked to make running much easier and helps the body burn fats more efficiently. Try to aim for about 4 milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight. For a 150 pound woman, that’s would be like in a 18-ounce coffee. So don’t forget your coffee before heading for your next run.</p><p><br></p><h2>11. Socialise your running</h2><p><img alt="People running together in a park" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/11-socialise-your-running.jpg" width="700" height="800" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/11-socialise-your-running.jpg"></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Running may seem like a solitary pursuit, but there is a great amount of benefits to making a connection with others- and no better way to do that than by running with a group. There are many websites like meetup.com, thepecul.com which can help you in finding a local group with same interest. Or perhaps you just stop at your local running store and make new friends with same passion for running.</p><p><br></p><h2>12. Brag to others about your running</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Psychology says that when we brag about something then we start holding ourselves responsible for the non-commitment of that act in the future. We must admit that we all love to brag about our good stuff, so why leave running behind? Shout out to people when you reach your workout goals. Share it on your social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and twitter. Call your buddies. And now there are so many applications like runtastic, runkeeper, Nike plus so on and so forth so that you can accurately track your miles and even share on various social media platforms. Bragging about running sounds a bit idiosyncratic but somewhere down the line it helps.</p><p><br></p><h2>13. Mind the incline</h2><p><br></p><p>This point holds accountable especially for beginners i.e. when you are just getting started for running then you should avoids difficult terrains. Never accelerate down the hill. The shattering forces on your body can destroy your ankle and knees. This may not only affect your body but also mind by demeaning you and thus you will finally give up all over on running. So be gradual in practice, initially avoid difficult tracks. Remember the saying, “Patience is the fastest path to success.” Once you get hold of it then follow difficult terrains.</p><p><br></p><h2>14. Don’t even think about others</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You don’t need to compare yourself to become a better runner. Everyone has their own capabilities and learning curve. Just compare your progress with yourself. There will always be someone faster and leaner and who will seem more like a runner than you do. The key to success is to focus on your own improvements that you want to make for yourself. Keeping a track on your set of goals over the months can be really motivating and helpful in long run.</p><p><br></p><h2>15. Fuel yourself properly</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>If you have eaten a large meal before your running session, then wait at least two to three hours before you head out. Almost anything you eat immediately before a workout will digest enough to provide you energy during your sprint. If you still have to eat, choose something your body can easily digest, that can be a banana, a few handful of peanut butter or honey, or may be few grams of almonds.</p><p><br></p><h2>16. Keep hydrating yourself</h2><p><img alt="Sports woman drinking water to keep herself hydrated" src="http://www.wellnez.in:9000/wellnez/img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/16-keep-hydrating-yourself.jpg" width="700" height="467" class="blog-img" data-mce-src="../../img/blog-img/default/running-tips-must-know/16-keep-hydrating-yourself.jpg"></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It is so common yet most neglected by beginners. It’s highly recommended to drink at least eight glasses of water an hour before going out for running session in order to prevent dehydration. If you are going for a longer workout let\'s say like 10k, then you might consider taking a water bottle or perhaps planning a route that has a water stop along the way. Staying hydrated will definitely keep your legs from cramping, especially in summer time. Dehydration can have worse effects on your body like you may get fainted and a black-out feeling.</p><p><br></p><h2>17. Learning to cool down:</h2><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>After you complete your miles, don’t forget to do a two to five minutes cool easy down run, then stretch your body thoroughly. Don’t just immediately jump back into your car and go off to your next event, this may lead you to walking around with tight legs for the rest of the day. Doing a bit of cool down and stretching period allows the lactic acid (it is the bi-product created by leg’s muscles) to be drained out into your bloodstream and eliminate from your body. Also taking a hot bath or just relaxing in a hot bath tub after your workout can be really relaxing for your muscles. You can also pamper your body by taking a good massage.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>',
